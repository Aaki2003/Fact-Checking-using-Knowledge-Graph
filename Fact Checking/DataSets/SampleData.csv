19543,7740,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aclu-trump-used-the-word-america/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 30 January 2018, President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address, eliciting both praise and criticism, including a written response from Faiz Shakir of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemning Trump's speech as exclusionary and divisive. In a classic case of either missing or purposely misrepresenting the point (it's hard to tell which), the right-wing web site CNS News published an article (and other sites with a similar slant reposted it) declaring that the ACLU had complained that Trump repeated the word 'America' more than 80 times during his address: The American Civil Liberties Union - note the word 'American' in its title - complained Tuesday night about President Trump's repeated use of the word 'America' in his State of the Union speech. In a written response to Trump's speech, Faiz Shakir, the ACLU's national political director, said: Tonight, President Trump said the word 'America' more than 80 times in his speech. Yet, after a divisive first year, we hear and feel how exclusionary that 'America' is, with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities, both in the courts and at the polls. In particular, the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the President's deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let America's Dreamers be deported. We, too, counted more than 80 instances of 'America' (including variants such as 'American' or 'Americans') in a transcript of the address, but that's neither here nor there. We're not shocked or dismayed, and we can only assume the political director of the ACLU wasn't shocked or dismayed, that a presidential address would contain so many references to America and Americans. The shocker, rather, is that CNS News had the temerity to open their article with a statement directly contradicted by the quote that followed, in which Shakir clearly did not complain about Trump's repeated use of the word 'America.' On the contrary, he criticized Trump for advocating immigration policies that, in his view, go against everything 'America' stands for.Recent Updates Correction [2 February 2018]: The State of the Union speech took place on 30 January 2018, not 20 January as a previous version of this article erroneously stated.

Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.' Pitts is very close on the first part, and he's correct on the second. So we rate his statement True.","In a recent Medium post, Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country. 'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day,' Pitts wrote. 'Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.' We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. The CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together. In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses. That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine. The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths. Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That's close enough for us. We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent. So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms? According to CDC, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions. So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts' second claim correct.",,,,"'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day.

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. Following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, in which former Vice President Joe Biden had been declared the winner, Americans awaited word on a second round of stimulus check payments to provide relief during the economic downturn in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Oct. 30, 2020, President Donald Trump took questions outside the White House prior to boarding Marine One. The last question from the news media was about when stimulus relief may be coming, with a reporter asking: 'Stimulus. Are you, what about, what's happening here?' Trump answered, beginning in the video at the 5:54 mark: We're going to have a tremendous, we will have, do you want me to answer that one Steve? We will have a tremendous stimulus package immediately after the election. And I think we're going to take back the House. I think we're going to do very well in the Senate, little bit more complex, frankly. And I think we're going to have a fantastic presidential election, because nobody has done more than this administration in the first three and a half years. There's never been a president or an administration that's done more than we have for our farmers, for our manufacturers, for everybody in terms of tax cuts, for our military, what we've done with the military in terms of budget, $2.5 trillion. We'll be completing the wall very shortly. We're up over 400 miles. Nobody has done what we've done even close. So I think we're going to have a great election. People are going to realize that. That's why you have the big turnouts. That's why you have the big crowds. So we'll see you there. Ok? It is true that Trump said that, 'We will have a tremendous stimulus package immediately after the election.' In the week after the election, CNBC reported on Nov. 9 that 'it could take until January before more coronavirus stimulus relief is finalized.' Millions of Americans are waiting for more financial help from the federal government. Following President-elect Joe Biden's win, it now looks more probable that another coronavirus relief package may not come until January. That's even as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has vowed to make another deal a priority in the chamber now. As for what a payment amount might be in a second round of stimulus checks, Business Insider reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be smaller than the first stimulus checks, which promised varying payments dictated by income of $1,200 for individuals, or $2,400 for married couples, plus $500 for each child under age 17. He cited a jobs report that said 'the economy gained 638,000 jobs in October,' using that 'as a reason to support a slimmer relief plan instead of the more ambitious bill Democrats want.' McConnell mentioned the reason for the second payment likely being 'smaller' than the first one sent out in April as being 'more appropriate' because the coronavirus is 'not going away until we get a vaccine.' Democrats previously introduced comprehensive legislation on May 12 that included direct payments, passing the bill in the U.S. House on May 15 with no Republican support. Trump dismissed the bill as being 'dead on arrival' in the U.S. Senate. The Associated Press reported on Oct. 29 that talks between Democrats and Republicans had 'dragged on for months without producing results.' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a scolding assessment, blaming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for failing to produce answers to her demands for Democratic priorities as part of the approximately $2 trillion aid package. President Donald Trump again promised 'a very big package as soon as the election is over' and faulted Pelosi for the pre-election standoff that has rattled markets and shows, at least for now, no signs of easing. The Associated Press also noted in October that talks during lame-duck sessions 'often fail to deliver.' Despite opposition from the Trump administration, President-elect Joe Biden is currently in the process of transitioning into the White House ahead of Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2021. Biden has laid out his incoming administration's 'plan to combat coronavirus (COVID-19) and prepare for future global health threats,' which includes economic relief. In 2009, Biden looked on as President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, passing a stimulus package that initially provided $400 for individuals and $800 for couples. The economic relief came in the wake of the Great Recession that began prior to Obama's 2009 inauguration. At this time, there has been no official announcement regarding if or when more stimulus checks are coming.","Did Trump Promise 'Tremendous Stimulus Package Immediately After the Election'?

1813,105134,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/21/mark-born/no-private-insurance-doesnt-provide-better-coverag/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling Born said in an interview that 'private insurance gives ... better coverage' than people would get under a Medicaid expansion. This is wrong on multiple levels. Expanding Medicaid to people making 138% of the federal poverty level gives insurance coverage to tens of thousands of people that are currently uninsured - clearly 'better coverage.' Born also asserts cost is not part of which coverage is 'better,' but that is not how things work. The cost of premiums, deductibles and copays are a fundamental part of everyone's health insurance and health care decision-making, and studies show a clear connection between cost and an ability to access care. Some specialties do have fewer options under Medicaid than private insurance, but generally speaking studies and experts say the care access is comparable between the two. And Born didn't make a claim specific to health care access, he claimed overall coverage was better on private insurance. We rate that claim False.","A Medicaid expansion - cut two years ago from Gov. Tony Evers' first budget by the Republicans - is back on the table in his 2021-23 spending plan. The recycled proposal from Evers, a Democrat, has garnered a predictably unenthusiastic reception from Republicans who control the state Legislature. The expansion would lean on federal funds to expand Medicaid eligibility to people with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, instead of the current 100%. Wisconsin is one of 12 states that have not adopted the Medicaid expansion. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, a co-chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, made his case against Medicaid in a March 21, 2021, appearance on WKOW's 'Capital City Sunday.' He called the access to one-time funding a 'federal bribe ... to expand that welfare program,' then talked about the financial impact on the parties involved. 'We've got people right now covered on private insurance through the exchange here in Wisconsin, and we know that that private insurance gives them better coverage and better payments to our health systems,' Born said. The lower payments to health systems for Medicaid-covered patients have been well-documented. The reimbursements Medicaid pays to health care providers are about half what private insurers pay nationwide - though we'll note the state has the ability to set higher reimbursement rates, if Born and other leaders felt that was a problem that should be addressed. But the other portion of his claim is more unique. Does private insurance really provide 'better coverage' to the individual than Medicaid? Born turned to some convoluted logic to defend this claim, which experts say doesn't hold water. Let's take a look. Key group overlooked Born's first mistake is ignoring the uninsured. Increasing the allowable income for Medicaid would move the cutoff for a single adult from $12,880 to $17,774. That would make about 90,000 additional Wisconsinites eligible for Medicaid. Between one-third and one-half of that group is currently uninsured, depending on whether you go by estimates from the state Department of Health Services or the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. So it's wrong to dismiss Medicaid as not offering 'better coverage' when there's a large group of people who could use the program and currently have no coverage at all. Cost is part of gauging coverage quality But Born is also wrong about the coverage being better. Asked for proof of that claim, Born spokesman Tyler Clark said cost shouldn't be considered as part of the discussion over which plans offer 'better coverage' - only the number of health care providers that accept Medicaid vs. private insurance. 'Rep. Born didn't make a statement relating to cost,' Clark said in an email. 'Value the Representative is talking about is what you get for a plan, and it is also undeniable that access to primary and dental care under Medicaid is less than commercial private plans. ... Anything else is not relevant to fact-checking his words.' But that flies in the face of how the health insurance industry references quality of coverage. The Affordable Care Act marketplace, for example, places the various options into four tiers - bronze, silver, gold, platinum - based on the out-of-pocket costs involved. In other words, which one is better is defined by how much each costs the user. More importantly, the logic Clark puts forth ignores that - just like the number of available providers - cost is a critical part of access to care. A plethora of available doctors on a private insurance plan does no good if the cost of care is so high the person can't afford to see them. 'You cannot separate those two (cost and access),' said Donna Friedsam, a distinguished researcher and health policy programs director at the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty. 'If you can't pay for your care, that's a huge access barrier.' The impact of that barrier is clear when comparing the states that so far have accepted and refused the Medicaid expansion. In states that expanded Medicaid, 9% of eligible low-income adults reported not getting needed medical care due to cost, while in states without the expansion 20% of that income group passed on care, according to a 2018 study from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Another 2018 study comparing those groups found states that expanded Medicaid had fewer uninsured among the people eligible, and that group also saw a drop in out-of-pocket spending. It concluded states that substitute marketplace plans for Medicaid expansion - as Wisconsin has done so far - 'could lower coverage rates and increase out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees.' So, yes, cost matters. And Medicaid is undeniably cheaper. Medicaid requires no premiums for those who would be eligible under the proposed expansion, and most people also pay little or nothing for services. 'At most you might pay a couple of bucks for a copayment, but it's generally zero,' said Joe Antos, a health care scholar with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. 'In terms of just money out of pocket, it's a better deal than any private coverage. Because all private coverage even with (Affordable Care Act) coverage and the big subsidies that have been expanded, there's going to be a premium of some sort, there's going to be a deductible, there's going to be copays or coinsurance.' Fewer care options under Medicaid? The point Born asserted he was trying to make is that private insurance gives a person access to more doctors than Medicaid. Kaiser - a nonpartisan organization considered the gold standard for health care analysis - said in a 2019 explainer on Medicaid: 'Rates of access to care and satisfaction with care among Medicaid enrollees are comparable to rates for people with private insurance.' The report noted there are access gaps for psychiatrists, some specialists and dentists, but those are the same fields where access is limited throughout the system due to a shortage of providers. Friedsam said Wisconsin is in better shape than many states in terms of Medicaid care access. 'In Wisconsin we actually have very robust participation by most physicians in the Medicaid programs,' she said. 'We do have a number of studies showing that Medicaid members overall do fairly comparably to other low-income, privately insured members.' A 2016 Medicaid access study from the state Department of Health Services found 87% of primary care physicians in the state participated in Medicaid, with 72% of that group seeing enough patients to be considered active. But only 37% of dentists were in Medicaid, and less than half were considered active. It's important to note that most private health insurance plans don't include any dental coverage, however - those have to be purchased separately. So any dental coverage from Medicaid is an improvement over private health insurance.",,,,'Private insurance gives ... better coverage' than people would get under a Medicaid expansion.,refuted,false,"<p>But the cost of premiums, deductibles and copays are a fundamental part of everyone's health insurance decisions.

Chris Christie recently credited one of his Democratic predecessors for saving New Jersey drivers some money. Christie, a Republican, said former Gov. Jim McGreevey helped reduce auto insurance rates in a state where drivers struggled for decades with high costs and few insurance options. 'I've got to give a shoutout to Governor McGreevey,' Christie said in an 'On the Line' interview with Steve Adubato. 'He did a very good job on that while he was governor and our auto insurance, while still high, is not anywhere near as high as it used to be about a decade ago. And that's because we went to market-based solutions that brought more folks in here, created more competition, and now you have lower rates.' Any New Jerseyan with four wheels and a driver's license knows insuring those four wheels can get expensive. But are drivers in the state better off because of changes enacted by McGreevey? First, let's tackle how auto insurance rates have fared over time. According to data compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators, the average combined premium in New Jersey dropped from $1,316.49 in 1998 to $1,197.91 in 2008, the most recent year analyzed by the association. The state's average combined premium, which is the average price for a policy that includes liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, peaked in 2004 at $1,386.46. PolitiFact New Jersey also looked at the average expenditure, a statistic that aims to measure what motorists spent on average for car insurance, including those who buy only liability coverage. The average expenditure in New Jersey dropped to $1,081.28 in 2008 from $1,138.28 in 1998. It peaked at $1,221.08 in 2004, according to NAIC numbers. The NAIC notes that these measurements are calculated with no distinction for deductibles, vehicle types and other factors that can affect auto insurance rates, and does not rank states because of these issues. However, the rankings can be compiled from data in the reports. According to our analysis, New Jersey had the most expensive combined average premiums in the nation, including Washington, D.C., from 1998 to 2004. In 2005 and 2006, D.C. pulled ahead and New Jersey dropped to second. But for the two most recent years of data, 2007 and 2008, New Jersey has ranked third, behind D.C. and Louisiana. The state's rankings for average expenditure have a similar trend. Is McGreevey the reason for the drop? In 2003, McGreevey enacted changes to the state's auto insurance regulations in a bid to attract more insurance companies to the state, increase competition and lower rates. The same year, California-based Mercury General, opened in New Jersey and other major insurance companies followed. Although New Jersey's average combined premium and average expenditure on auto insurance peaked in 2004, they have fallen annually since then, according to NAIC data. But rates have also decreased nationally since 2004. A national expert on auto insurance told us that while the movement in rates in New Jersey mirrors national trends 'to some extent,' costs are being pushed down by state reform efforts from McGreevey in 2003, and from reforms enacted in the late 1990s. 'It's become a much more attractive place for companies,' said David Snyder, American Insurance Association vice president and associate general counsel. Three other industry experts said the reforms enacted during McGreevey's tenure deserve significant -- if not complete -- credit for cheaper auto insurance in New Jersey. John Dyke, a trustee of the trade group New Jersey Auto Agents Alliance, said 'the reforms actually do help a lot because they drive competition within the market place.' The economy also is a factor, Dyke said, because more people are opting for less coverage. Chuck Leitgeb, vice president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, an organization that represents insurance companies in New Jersey, largely attributed the drop in prices to the reforms. The drop in the average expenditure is 'unquestionably the results of the reforms,' said Brian Sullivan, editor of Risk Information, which covers the insurance industry. 'They've unleashed a competitive frenzy in New Jersey.' Let's recap. Christie said market-based reforms enacted during McGreevey's tenure helped drive down auto insurance costs in New Jersey, and experts we spoke with said reforms enacted in 2003 played a significant -- if not complete -- role in reducing rates. We rate Christie's statement True. Featured Fact-check Frank Lautenberg stated on June 15, 2011 in an interview on ABC's 'Top Line' 'Since 2004, there have been some 1,300 attacks (on rail targets).

Jim McGreevey helped reduce auto insurance rates in a state where drivers struggled for decades with high costs and few insurance options. 'I've got to give a shoutout to Governor McGreevey,' Christie said in an 'On the Line' interview with Steve Adubato. 'He did a very good job on that while he was governor and our auto insurance, while still high, is not anywhere near as high as it used to be about a decade ago. And that's because we went to market-based solutions that brought more folks in here, created more competition, and now you have lower rates.' Any New Jerseyan with four wheels and a driver's license knows insuring those four wheels can get expensive. But are drivers in the state better off because of changes enacted by McGreevey? First, let's tackle how auto insurance rates have fared over time. According to data compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators, the average combined premium in New Jersey dropped from $1,316.49 in 1998 to $1,197.91 in 2008, the most recent year analyzed by the association. The state's average combined premium, which is the average price for a policy that includes liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, peaked in 2004 at $1,386.46. PolitiFact New Jersey also looked at the average expenditure, a statistic that aims to measure what motorists spent on average for car insurance, including those who buy only liability coverage. The average expenditure in New Jersey dropped to $1,081.28 in 2008 from $1,138.28 in 1998. It peaked at $1,221.08 in 2004, according to NAIC numbers. The NAIC notes that these measurements are calculated with no distinction for deductibles, vehicle types and other factors that can affect auto insurance rates, and does not rank states because of these issues. However, the rankings can be compiled from data in the reports. According to our analysis, New Jersey had the most expensive combined average premiums in the nation, including Washington, D.C., from 1998 to 2004. In 2005 and 2006, D.C. pulled ahead and New Jersey dropped to second. But for the two most recent years of data, 2007 and 2008, New Jersey has ranked third, behind D.C. and Louisiana. The state's rankings for average expenditure have a similar trend. Is McGreevey the reason for the drop? In 2003, McGreevey enacted changes to the state's auto insurance regulations in a bid to attract more insurance companies to the state, increase competition and lower rates. The same year, California-based Mercury General, opened in New Jersey and other major insurance companies followed. Although New Jersey's average combined premium and average expenditure on auto insurance peaked in 2004, they have fallen annually since then, according to NAIC data. But rates have also decreased nationally since 2004. A national expert on auto insurance told us that while the movement in rates in New Jersey mirrors national trends 'to some extent,' costs are being pushed down by state reform efforts from McGreevey in 2003, and from reforms enacted in the late 1990s. 'It's become a much more attractive place for companies,' said David Snyder, American Insurance Association vice president and associate general counsel. Three other industry experts said the reforms enacted during McGreevey's tenure deserve significant -- if not complete -- credit for cheaper auto insurance in New Jersey. John Dyke, a trustee of the trade group New Jersey Auto Agents Alliance, said 'the reforms actually do help a lot because they drive competition within the market place.' The economy also is a factor, Dyke said, because more people are opting for less coverage. Chuck Leitgeb, vice president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, an organization that represents insurance companies in New Jersey, largely attributed the drop in prices to the reforms. The drop in the average expenditure is 'unquestionably the results of the reforms,' said Brian Sullivan, editor of Risk Information, which covers the insurance industry. 'They've unleashed a competitive frenzy in New Jersey.' Let's recap. Christie said market-based reforms enacted during McGreevey's tenure helped drive down auto insurance costs in New Jersey, and experts we spoke with said reforms enacted in 2003 played a significant -- if not complete -- role in reducing rates. We rate Christie's statement True.

Bush at the same point in his presidency. While this discrepancy is explained by the fact that Bush often worked from a family home in Texas whereas Obama has no equivalent family retreat, Sharpton has correctly cited data from the leading authority, CBS News' Mark Knoller. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.","As President Barack Obama begins a vacation on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, social media and blogs are buzzing with details of Obama's vacations, past and present. Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who is considered the authority on tracking the president's daily activities, recently tweeted that 'no presidential numbers I report stir as much reaction and resentment as vacations -- except one: golf.' Obama's vacation plans have attracted heat from some of his critics, who say the cost of moving the president, his family and his Secret Service protection are an extravagance that taxpayers still stung by the weak economic recovery shouldn't have to pay for. Obama and his family are reportedly staying at a $7.6 million vacation home of Democratic donor David Schulte. The president's supporters counter that the unique security concerns for the president mean that he and his family can't simply head out on the road and plop down at a Motel 6. They add that all presidents have to be accessible for consultation and decisionmaking even if they're on vacation, and that every occupant of the White House, from both parties, has followed essentially the same procedures for vacations. As the Obamas took off for Martha's Vineyard, one of their defenders was the Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosts a show on MSNBC. On the Aug. 9. 2013, edition of PoliticsNation, Sharpton said, 'We all love summer traditions, fireworks, barbecues, the beach. And we're seeing the return of a right-wing favorite -- attacking the president's vacation.' Sharpton cut to a clip of Fox News' Sean Hannity saying that Obama 'is living a pretty extravagant lifestyle, isn't he? Martha's Vineyard, big expensive vacations, Hawaii, while 50 million Americans, Dana, are on food stamps.' In reality, Sharpton told viewers, Obama 'has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in. How many did President (George W.) Bush take by the same point in his presidency? Three hundred and sixty seven. Yes, more than a full year of vacation.' We wondered whether Sharpton was right that Obama's predecessor took many more vacation days than he has. When we asked MSNBC for the source of Sharpton's data, a spokeswoman pointed to a story in USA Today. The article says, 'At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller.' Tweets by Knoller himself back that up. On the eve of Obama's departure for Martha's Vineyard, Knoller tweeted that 'since taking office, Pres Obama has taken 14 vacation trips spanning all or part of 92 days.' Knoller also tweeted that 'at the same point in office, Pres. GWBush had made 50 visits to this Texas Ranch totaling all or part of 323 days.' Another 26 of Bush's vacation days are accounted for by trips to Kennebunkport, with 18 days on vacation at miscellaneous locations, according to Knoller's data. Trips to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland are not included in either president's figures. It's worth noting that there was a difference in the two presidents' patterns of vacations. As the USA Today article noted, Obama doesn't own a vacation home, unlike Bush, who owned his ranch. So while Bush essentially used the ranch as as a working White House, Obama has traveled to a variety of destinations, including his native Hawaii. Because of this, the government may have been able to accrue some per-trip cost savings for Bush by going repeatedly to one location. But since the White House is traditionally tight-lipped about costs and security details for presidential travel, it's impossible to know how the total cost of Bush's travel compares to Obama's.",,,,"Says President Barack Obama 'has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in,' compared to 367 for President George W.

Within hours of that massacre, fake news sites were shamelessly exploiting the tragedy for personal gain by disseminating fabricated information about the shooter. One common theme to such fake news stories was that the shooter was connected to the 'Antifa' movement: The gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by 'targeting white conservative churches' and causing anarchy in the United States. Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers 'this is a communist revolution' before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times. As of this writing little is known about Devin Kelley or his motivation for attacking a church, but neither police nor any reputable news organization has offered a desire 'to start a civil war by targeting white conservative churches' as a motive for the shooting, nor reported that Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told churchgoers that he was participating in 'a communist revolution': Preliminary news reports suggested instead that law enforcement had few clues to explain why Kelley went on a shooting rampage or targeted the church in Sutherland Springs: Few clues were initially made public on a possible motive or what made Kelley target a church in tiny Sutherland Springs. His in-laws had attended the church at some point, said Joe D. Tackitt, Jr., the Wilson County sheriff. They were not present Sunday and only came to the scene later after hearing the news he said. 'There must have been some reason he came here, but we don't know,' Tackitt said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) suggested that 'there may have been a reason why this particular location was targeted,' though he did not go into detail, saying that the details could emerge in the coming hours or days. 'I don't think this is a random act of shooting, a randomly chosen location, but obviously someone who is very deranged,' Abbott said in an interview on the 'Today' show. Antifa United declared that the purported image of Devin Kelley's Facebook page, which includes an Antifa flag, was likewise a fabrication:",Was the Texas Church Shooter an Antifa Member Who Vowed to Start Civil War?

Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state's largest business group, the week of June 1, 2011 launched a statewide radio ad campaign pushing for swift approval of legislation that allows mine planning to move forward. The group sees approval of the mine bill as a top priority, said Scott Manley, director of environmental policy. One version of the ad is directed at residents of southeastern Wisconsin, and specifically those represented by state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills. She's one of six Republican and three Democrat state senators facing recall elections this summer. That ad urges listeners to call Darling's office and ask her to support the 'Jobs for Generations Act.' The ad says the mine project will create 2,000 jobs initially 'and sustain thousands of jobs statewide for years to come.' 'Over the 100 year life of the mine, it will generate billions of dollars in economic activity, and millions of dollars in tax revenue to pay for schools, libraries, roads, parks and other vital services.' WMC's ad stirs several questions, including what this mine has to do with residents in southeastern Wisconsin, and why Darling is a focus of the ad. There's also another issue: No legislation has been introduced. More about these below. The ad states that the mine will be open for 100 years, and will be a boon to the state's economy. Let's look at the broader impact of the mine, and how realistic it is that it would operate for so long and have such an impact. We'll set aside for now the considerable environmental concerns that make this project highly controversial. The mine would be located in a remote section of far northern Wisconsin, about 25 miles southeast of Ashland, near the burg of Mellen. The project is proposed by Gogebic Taconite, a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company based in Florida with operations in Illinois and the Appalachian mountains. The firm holds the rights to mine the iron ore in a 22-mile-long portion of the ore body. The company would dig out the ore, crush it, and use water and magnets to extract the iron and then return the unused material, or tailings, back to the ground. Gogebic wants to speed up the permitting process and eliminate steps that can be used by opponents to create years of delays. They want to condense a five- to seven-year process to 300 days. The key to the project is the massive amount of iron ore believed to be there. Remember: We're talking about the key component used to make the steel used in the cars and trucks of the future. There are various estimates about the amount of iron ore at the Gogebic site. One estimate by the U.S. Geologic Survey says in excess of 2 billion tons. An earlier estimate said there was 3.7 billion tons. The company is only seeking permission to mine the first phase, a 4.5 mile by 1.5 mile stretch along State Highway 77 east of Mellen. One projection says that the company could process about 8 million tons of ore a year, based on the current demand and prices for steel. That phase would be mined for about 35 years, the company says. At 8 million tons a year, that's less than 15 percent of the low-end estimated ore deposit. At that rate, it's going to take a lot longer than 100 years to dig up all of the ore. The WMC's 100 year claim is based on the 2 billion tons estimate. But the PolitiFact calculator says that at 8 million tons a year, it would take 250 years. WMC's Manley admitted that the 100 year claim was an estimate that depends 'on how quickly you can dig out 2.2 billion tons or iron ore.' So the business group's claim is off by more than a bit. But there's are problems with their estimate beyond simple math. The permit being sought is for 35 years, in one phase. The company would have to seek another permit - or more than one - for expansion of the mine. 'The future of this proposed mine ultimately depends on the economics of the world iron ore market and the future of the domestic iron and steel industry,' wrote Bruce A. Brown of the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey in a study about the project.. Gogebic Taconite says that the project would employ about 700 direct mining jobs, and 2,834 total jobs created from related businesses. Construction of the mine would create 3,000 jobs and have a $2 billion economic impact on the state, according to a study done by Gogebic by economist David Ward of NorthStar Economics. Ward says the ripple effort of the mine's operation would be $604 million, and produce $17 million in state and local taxes. That effect, too, extends the impact of the mine hundreds of miles, including to southeastern Wisconsin, home to mining equipment makers Joy Global and Bucyrus International. That's some project. But that's not what's before the Legislature. In fact, nothing is before lawmakers right now. And Sen. Darling hasn't indicated she's opposed to the project. A draft proposal of the mine law was circulated last month and scheduled for a hearing in a rushed fashion. But then it was pulled back for retooling. The WMC ad isn't limited to Darling's district. Similar versions are being aired statewide and in the districts of all six Republican senators who face recall elections. One thing is clear: The mining company (and WMC) want to get the bill approved while the Republicans control both the legislative and executive branches of state government. If the GOP loses the state Senate in the recall elections, the bill could face big delays. So where does that leave us? The state's largest business group is ramping up the effort on behalf of Gogebic Taconite. They want state law changed so the company can receive speedier consideration -- and presumably approval -- of permits to mine iron ore in northern Wisconsin. Injecting the mine ads into the recall campaigns could lead to a quicker vote; it's also a move by WMC to link business-friendly Darling to a project that could create many of jobs. If approved, the mine could operate for decades and employ thousands of people. Yet the WMC ads take the extra leap of referring to the mine as having a 100 year life. That's a leap. Any vote before today's Legislature would be for the first 35 year phase. Another permit would be required to extend the project's life. And the 100 year claim is based on current demand for steel. In short, it's a complete guess. It's no surprise the state's largest business group wants to put the best possible spin on a project that will generate heated debate. Surely, the mine could generate an economic boon to numerous parts of the state. But the claim leaves out some critical information -- the permits, details of the legislation, and assumptions of the market for steel decades in the future -- as it makes a sweeping claim about jobs and longevity. We rate the claim Mostly True.

35519,111021,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/sep/11/brett-hulsey/wisconsin-rep-brett-hulsey-says-only-one-376-bill-/, ,0,0,,,"In early August 2011, after surveys tagged him as possibly the nation's most polarizing governor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pledged a renewed focus on bi-partisanship and jobs. Later that month, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, R-Horicon, echoed the call. He said some jobs-related bills proposed by Democrats were good and would take them up by the Assembly after it returns from its summer recess on Sept. 13, 2011. Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, professed doubts about the sincerity of the GOP calls for bi-partisanship. On Aug. 27, 2011, the day Fitzgerald's comments were posted online, Hulsey said in an opinion column in The Capital Times of Madison: 'On the floor of the Legislature, Assembly Republicans have rubber-stamped Walker's corporate agenda while rejecting hundreds of Democratic amendments, even though many were common-sense measures that emphasized accountability or saved money. So far, Republicans have accepted only one out of 376 amendments offered by Assembly Democrats.' Bi-partisanship, of course, can be measured in many ways. But the one-out-of-376 statistic caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. We started by asking Hulsey to clarify his statement. Hulsey said that of all the bills adopted by the Assembly in 2011 before it adjourned for the summer, only one of 376 amendments proposed by a Democrat was adopted. Some amendments were proposed on the Assembly floor and others in Assembly committees, he said. The single Democrat-sponsored amendment that was approved, according to Hulsey, was to Assembly Bill 94. That bill made administrative changes to the Milwaukee school choice program, which uses taxpayer dollars to send children to private schools. The amendment was introduced by Rep. Jason Fields, D-Milwaukee, a school choice supporter. It specifies that a pupil currently participating in the choice program may continue to attend a private school if their family's income increases above current income eligibility requirements and that the pupil's siblings are not subject to current income eligibility requirements, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal and other services to legislative committees. To check Hulsey's numbers, we contacted the Assembly chief clerk's office, which referred us to the Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau. Hulsey contacted the bureau, as well. The bureau determined there were even more Democratic amendments than Hulsey had claimed -- 399 -- and that only the Fields amendment was adopted. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and Fitzgerald spokesman John Jagler about the numbers. Neither disputed them. Jagler said many of the Democratic amendments were voted down because they were politically motivated. He also said that for the 2009-2011 state budget -- adopted when Democrats controlled the governor's office and both chambers of the Legislature -- Republicans offered more than 120 amendments and none were adopted. That suggests Hulsey's statement is just a measure of the reality of what happens when one party has outright control in Madison. Is the number of opposition amendments adopted a good measure of bi-partisanship? We put that question to two former state lawmakers, one from each party, who served in both the Assembly and the Senate. Mordecai Lee, a Democrat who represented Milwaukee and now teaches governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said the sheer volume of Democratic amendments rejected by the Republican-controlled Assembly is evidence 'that these people despise each other.' Brian Rude, a lobbyist and a Republican who represented the La Crosse area, agreed that the number of rejected amendments indicates a split, but added: 'Partisanship has always been part of the process.

Featured Fact-check Viral image stated on November 13, 2021 in a viral image Kyle Rittenhouse's mother 'drove him across state lines and dropped him off in the middle of a riot armed with an assault rifle' in Kenosha. By Tom Kertscher • November 15, 2021","In early August 2011, after surveys tagged him as possibly the nation's most polarizing governor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pledged a renewed focus on bi-partisanship and jobs. Later that month, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, R-Horicon, echoed the call. He said some jobs-related bills proposed by Democrats were good and would take them up by the Assembly after it returns from its summer recess on Sept. 13, 2011. Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, professed doubts about the sincerity of the GOP calls for bi-partisanship. On Aug. 27, 2011, the day Fitzgerald's comments were posted online, Hulsey said in an opinion column in The Capital Times of Madison: 'On the floor of the Legislature, Assembly Republicans have rubber-stamped Walker's corporate agenda while rejecting hundreds of Democratic amendments, even though many were common-sense measures that emphasized accountability or saved money. So far, Republicans have accepted only one out of 376 amendments offered by Assembly Democrats.' Bi-partisanship, of course, can be measured in many ways. But the one-out-of-376 statistic caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. We started by asking Hulsey to clarify his statement. Hulsey said that of all the bills adopted by the Assembly in 2011 before it adjourned for the summer, only one of 376 amendments proposed by a Democrat was adopted. Some amendments were proposed on the Assembly floor and others in Assembly committees, he said. The single Democrat-sponsored amendment that was approved, according to Hulsey, was to Assembly Bill 94. That bill made administrative changes to the Milwaukee school choice program, which uses taxpayer dollars to send children to private schools. The amendment was introduced by Rep. Jason Fields, D-Milwaukee, a school choice supporter. It specifies that a pupil currently participating in the choice program may continue to attend a private school if their family's income increases above current income eligibility requirements and that the pupil's siblings are not subject to current income eligibility requirements, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal and other services to legislative committees. To check Hulsey's numbers, we contacted the Assembly chief clerk's office, which referred us to the Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau. Hulsey contacted the bureau, as well. The bureau determined there were even more Democratic amendments than Hulsey had claimed -- 399 -- and that only the Fields amendment was adopted. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and Fitzgerald spokesman John Jagler about the numbers. Neither disputed them. Jagler said many of the Democratic amendments were voted down because they were politically motivated. He also said that for the 2009-2011 state budget -- adopted when Democrats controlled the governor's office and both chambers of the Legislature -- Republicans offered more than 120 amendments and none were adopted. That suggests Hulsey's statement is just a measure of the reality of what happens when one party has outright control in Madison. Is the number of opposition amendments adopted a good measure of bi-partisanship? We put that question to two former state lawmakers, one from each party, who served in both the Assembly and the Senate. Mordecai Lee, a Democrat who represented Milwaukee and now teaches governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said the sheer volume of Democratic amendments rejected by the Republican-controlled Assembly is evidence 'that these people despise each other.' Brian Rude, a lobbyist and a Republican who represented the La Crosse area, agreed that the number of rejected amendments indicates a split, but added: 'Partisanship has always been part of the process. Parties get elected to stand for something.' For his part, Werwie cited a spreadsheet produced by the governor's office on the 44 bills Walker has signed into law. It shows there were a total of 331 yes votes by Assembly Democrats on the bills. That means, on average, 7.5 of the 38 Democrats voted yes on each of the 44 bills.

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley believes he's cracked the code. He claimed as much in a May 16, 2011, speech on the Senate floor in which he urged his colleagues to pass legislation that would strip $2 billion in annual tax subsidies from the five biggest oil companies. (The bill failed.) 'So the companies are able to sell oil that costs no more to produce today than it did one month ago, no more to produce today than it did three months ago, when oil was much lower, no more expensive to produce today than one year ago, when it was $3 a gallon,' he said, noting that the price of oil as he spoke was $100 a barrel. With the economics of oil in constant flux, we will focus on the last part of Merkley's assertion, that oil is 'no more expensive to produce today than one year ago.' The ultimate price is derived from a complicated -- and dense -- synthesis of fixed costs, the financial markets, geopolitical developments (Libya, for example) and global economics. That includes actual fixed costs such as transporting and refining oil in addition to a highly fluctuating value added by commodity traders. That's why members of Congress, including Merkley, have been asking so many questions of late about the role of market speculators who by some estimates can add $20 or more to the cost of a barrel of oil. To back up his claim, Merkley cites a report by Democrats on the Finance Committee that finds production costs roughly the same from year to to year. That number, however, includes oil from old and very large fields that is much cheaper than oil from new and smaller deposits. He also points to testimony by ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to the Senate Finance Committee on May 12, 2011. Tillerson, who was actually responding to a question about the impact of speculators, seemed to corroborate Merkley's suggestion that the production cost has been stable. Noting that it's hard to judge, Tillerson estimated the cost at $60 to $70 a barrel. That includes all production costs, but not the additional costs added by the financial markets. John Felmy, the chief economist for the oil industry's trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, argues that Merkley is 'flat out wrong.' The costs fluctuate, he says, based on location, competition for crews and equipment and a host of other factors. There's also this: The true cost of finding oil and bringing it to the surface, which is known as the 'lifting cost,' is directly tied to the size of the deposit. The bigger the reserve, the lower the cost. That's a problem these days,Felmy says, because oil 'is getting progressively harder to find,' which means the deposit is usually smaller and the overall cost higher. Tillerson also raised the point that the costs of finding oil and bringing it to the surface increase as supplies dwindle. But he said that the industry has become more efficient and used improvements in technology to keep costs lower, making total production costs roughly the same. It's also worth noting that the 'finding costs' are only a fraction of the total cost of a barrel of oil. The Energy Information Administration, a federal department that independently collects and synthesizes data about energy production and costs, also shows production costs roughly the same from 2006 to 2009. Those are the most recent years for which data has been collected and published. While the total price of oil is known each day, EIA economist Neal Davis said, data on the production of oil lags more than a year behind. For that reason, he said, it's impossible to conclusively say whether Merkley's assertion is correct or not. He also said that costs vary from year to year so it is difficult to draw conclusions on future costs based on a previous year. Because no absolute answer can be given until new data is available, we think Merkley's statement needs clarification.

20687,9162,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/43-percent-food-stamps-illegal/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Since at least as far back as 2012, the claim that 43% of all 'food stamp' beneficiaries are 'illegal immigrants' has echoed through the murky and fact-starved worlds of social media, chain e-mails, and memes, often times shared as part of a larger list of 'Facts!' For example, the following post, from the Facebook page of Doug Giles - proprietor of 'ClashDaily.com' and author of the book Pussification: The Effeminization of the American Male - arnered tens of thousands of shares: The food stamp program, known since 2008 as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is not open to undocumented immigrants. ('A person must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible, lawfully-present non-citizen to qualify for SNAP benefits.') The only way for undocumented immigrants to (legally) collect SNAP benefits would be to apply for them on behalf of their lawfully present children, as described by the Associated Press in June 2017: People who are not legal residents of the U.S. are not eligible to take part in what is formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. But many poor families include a mix of non-legal residents and legal ones, such as children who have citizenship because they were born in the U.S. In those cases, it is often an adult who is not a legal resident who submits the application. And as that same report noted, even many non-citizens who are present in the U.S. lawfully still disdain applying for SNAP benefits due to the perception that doing so might affect their immigration status: About 3.9 million citizen children living with noncitizen parents received food stamps in the 2015 fiscal year, the most recent available data, according to the Department of Agriculture, which administers the food stamp program. The Department of Agriculture says a lower percentage of noncitizens who qualify for the program known as SNAP have historically used the benefit than citizens because of an incorrect perception that it could affect their immigration status or hurt their chances of becoming a U.S. citizen. Regardless, the notion that 43% of all SNAP beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants is mathematically impossible, even under a scenario in which every single undocumented immigrant in the United States somehow managed to make use of the program (legally or otherwise). In 2017, the most recent year for which we have data, 42,101,000 persons participated in the SNAP program, and 43% of that total comprises 18,103,430 SNAP participants. The most recent year for which we have comprehensive estimates of the undocumented immigrant population in the United States is 2014, and those estimates place the total figure of undocumented immigrant in the U.S. somewhere between 11.1 and 12.1 million. That latter figure has essentially been stable since 2009 (and was previously much lower). At no time in the last three decades or so has the undocumented population of the United States included anywhere close to 18 million persons, so it's simply not mathematically possible that '43% of all food stamps are given to illegals.'","Are 43 Percent of All Food Stamps 'Given to Illegals'?

We turned to the website of the Tax Foundation, which has a document that lists every tax bracket since the imposition of the federal income tax in 1913. It turns out Bachmann is right. In 1913, the federal tax code levied income taxes ranging from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the top rate of 7 percent levied on incomes of $500,000 and above (or the current equivalent of $11,332,304). At that time, there were no distinctions in filing status, such as individuals or married filing jointly. By 1980 -- just before Ronald Reagan ascended to the presidency -- the top rate was 70 percent for all filing categories. The top rate kicked in at $108,300 for individuals and $215,400 for married couples filing jointly, or $294,907 and $586,546, respectively, in today's money. For comparison's sake, the top rate today for all categories is 35 percent. And the top rate was actually higher before the 1980 level of 70 percent that Bachmann cited.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Facebook has banned InfoWars and associated accounts from its platform since 2019, citing concerns about hate speech and content promoting violence. Still, this article had been shared thousands of times on Facebook, so we wanted to take a closer look. (Screenshot from InfoWars) The story is wrong - the Energy Department did not 'block' Texas from increasing power production before the winter storm hit. The 'major smoking gun' cited by InfoWars is actually an emergency order that temporarily suspended federal emissions caps in the state so that some power plants could operate at maximum capacity. We reached out to InfoWars for a comment, but we haven't heard back. Energy Department granted request for increased power ERCOT stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It was created in 1970 to oversee the state's power grid beyond the reach of federal regulators. As freezing temperatures descended on large areas of the central and southern Plains, ERCOT asked its customers to conserve energy amid 'record-breaking electric demand.' On Feb. 15, ERCOT reported that about 34 gigawatts of power were offline, mainly due to frozen instruments at natural gas and coal plants. Before that outage, ERCOT sent a letter to acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga requesting emergency assistance. Specifically, the corporation asked the government to allow Texas power plants to exceed federal emissions requirements until Feb. 19 so that they could operate at maximum capacity. 'In ERCOT's judgment, the loss of power to homes and local businesses in the areas affected by curtailments presents a far greater risk to public health and safety than the temporary exceedances of those permit limits that would be allowed under the requested order,' ERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness wrote. 'This request is narrowly tailored to allow only the exceedances that are necessary to ensure reliability over the next few days.' The emissions ERCOT mentioned in its letter were sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide. The corporation also anticipated an influx of wastewater as a result of the increased demand for electricity. On Feb. 14, the same day ERCOT sent its letter, the Energy Department issued an emergency order granting ERCOT's request. 'Given the emergency nature of the expected load stress ... I have determined that additional dispatch of the Specified Resources is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest,' Huizenga wrote. 'Because the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, I am authorizing only the necessary additional generation, with reporting requirements as described below.' RELATED: How Fox News, far-right TV blamed green energy for Texas' power outages The emergency order applied predominantly to coal and natural gas plants. The Energy Department stipulated that ERCOT should 'exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources' to 'minimize an increase in emissions.' Many Facebook posts center on stipulations of the emergency order that permitted ERCOT to exceed emissions standards only under specific emergency levels. Those stipulations did not prevent Texas from ramping up its power production. In an emailed statement, the Energy Department told PolitiFact that its order 'allowed specified power plants to generate up to their maximum capacity in order to manage the expected increase in electricity demand.' We reached out to the White House and ERCOT for comments, but we haven't heard back.",,,,'Joe Biden's Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm',refuted,pants-fire,<p>The 'major smoking gun' cited by InfoWars is actually an emergency order that allowed power plants to operate at maximum capacity.</p>,politifact

35921,115555,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/mar/16/dan-pfeiffer/dan-pfeiffer-says-obamas-approval-rating-recent-mo/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling When asked about Obama's approval rating, Pfeiffer said, 'We've gained 3 points in the last couple months.' He's right that the aggregate of polling data suggests that Obama's low point was December, not early March, as the new WSJ/NBC poll said. But there's some variation in how big of a rebound Obama's approval rating has seen. While Real Clear Politics says its 3 percent (buoyed by two outliers), Huffington Post put it at less than a percentage point. Franklin said it was somewhere in between those two. Pfeiffer's correct that the president's poll numbers are up slightly over the past few months. But they remain low (and underwater), and the gains depend on how you run the numbers. We rate Pfeiffer's claim Mostly True. Correction: Charles Franklin said President Barack Obama's aggregate approval rating bottomed out at 41.98 percent in December 2013. An earlier version of this fact-check included a different figure.","Here's a smattering of headlines from the last week on President Barack Obama's polling numbers: Time: 'Poll: Obama's Approval Rating Sinks To New Low.' Politico: 'Poll: Obama approval at record low.' Wall Street Journal: 'WSJ/NBC News Poll: Obama's Approval Rating Hits New Low.' Des Moines Register: 'Obama job approval hits record low.' So you can imagine our surprise when White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer claimed Obama's numbers are actually up during an interview with Meet the Press host David Gregory. Here's the exchange. Gregory: 'We had a big poll out, Wall Street Journal/NBC News, this week. Here's what it found. Overall job approval for the president: 41 percent. Handling the economy: 41 percent. Same number when it came to foreign policy. And here's what's striking: Approval is 74 percent among Democrats. Sounds high, but it's the lowest that the president's had. ... The president has really slipped.' Pfeiffer: 'Public polls are a little bit all over the map. On the same day your poll came out, another poll came out that showed the president gaining 6 points in the last couple months. I've looked at a lot of data and let me tell you what we see. There's no question that everyone in Washington, the president included, took a big hit from the double whammy of a shutdown and the problems of healthcare.gov. We have stabilized and we're working our way back. If you look at the aggregate of public polling, we've gained 3 points in the last couple months.' We checked in with the White House to see where Pfeiffer got his numbers. A spokesman pointed us to Real Clear Politics, a political website that aggregates polling data and calculates an average. Obama's job approval has been underwater for some time. Since May of last year, more Americans polled expressed disapproval in Obama's job performance than approval. The gap has widened considerably since then. While the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this week has Obama hitting a new low with an approval rating of 41 percent, the White House noted the Real Clear Politics average had Obama bottom out in December with an approval rating of 39.8 percent. That came on Dec. 3 after several weeks of bad headlines about healthcare.gov's botched rollout. On March 17, Obama's aggregate poll numbers put his approval rating at 42.9 percent. That accounts for the 3-point jump that Pfeiffer claimed. The recent 'surge' in the average seems to be skewed largely by two outlier polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports and Bloomberg. In a survey from March 13-15, Rasmussen Reports said 49 percent of Americans approve of Obama, while 50 percent disapprove, a statistical dead heat. Bloomberg between March 7-10 found an even split among those surveyed -- 48 percent both approved and disapproved of Obama. That's a six-point improvement from December, when Bloomberg put his approval rating at 42 percent. The remainder of the polls included in the Real Clear Politics average showed Obama's net approval rating ranging from -8 (Public Policy Polling) to -16 (Fox News) percentage points. John McIntyre with Real Clear Politics said the average from Dec. 3 likely included six or more polls taken between mid to late November as well as daily tracking polls, but it's possible they weren't from the same pollsters as the current average (at press time McIntyre was looking into which polls were used and we'll update the post when he gets back to us). He added that a quick look at the numbers showed, based on Real Clear Politics' average, Pfeiffer was right, though he noted that the December average captured a weird time period as some polls shut down around the Thanksgiving holiday. Other poll aggregation methods, meanwhile, show much more modest gains by the president. Huffington Post, for example, tracks 88 polls and takes a snapshot of the daily tracking polls from Gallup and Rasmussen every three days. According to their model, Obama's aggregate approval rating was 42.5 percent on Dec. 2 (his low point) and has jumped just a bit to 43.3 percent. That's less than 1 percentage point, a considerably smaller improvement than Real Clear Politics' average. Charles Franklin, co-founder of pollster.com (which the Huffington Post now owns) and director of the Marquette Law School Poll in Milwaukee, walked us through his own aggregation of Obama's poll numbers. According to Franklin, Obama's low point came Dec. 2 when he registered an approval rating of 41.98 percent. He currently estimates the number at 44.38, a gain of about 2.4 percentage points. So all three poll averages show Obama's low point actually came in early December, but his bounceback varies depending on the methodology. 'There are various ways of 'averaging' or aggregating polls to estimate trends,' Franklin said. 'My bottom line: There has been some gain though it appears to be not as large as 3 points when using all available polls and a standard trend estimate. There may be a specific pollster you could find that has shown a 3 point gain, but that is cherry picking the one with a larger gain, rather than using all the polls as I and HuffPost do.'",,,,Says President Barack Obama's approval rating 'gained 3 points in the last couple months.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact
5481,2171,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tom-cotton-army-ranger/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Snopes first published this fact check on Jan. 24, 2021. Following publication, we received comments disputing our primary assertion that U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton's past statements that he had 'experience as a U.S. Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan' or that he 'made tough decisions as an Army Ranger in Iraq' were misleading. In response, we solicited further expert opinion on the matter. While we add new context in this Feb. 2, 2021, update, our rating remains unchanged. A primary point of contention was Snopes' overbroad statement that the term 'Ranger' was reserved only for members of the 75th Ranger Regiment. Our characterization was inaccurate. In brief, there are two groups of people (not including veterans who served in Ranger regiments in conflicts that predate creation of the 75th Regiment) who can fairly describe themselves as Army Rangers: soldiers who served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, and soldiers who have completed a rigorous two-month training program at the U.S. Army Ranger School. As we reported originally, Cotton completed U.S Army Ranger School. At issue is not whether Cotton is misleading people by saying he is an Army Ranger. He and anyone else who completed the program have earned the right to call themselves Rangers. The issue, instead, is the context in which he uses that term to describe himself, according to retired Maj. John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at West Point's Modern War Institute, whose 25-year military career included teaching at the U.S. Army Ranger School. 'Each graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger School can call themselves a Ranger or Ranger qualified,' Spencer told us by email, 'but the context of how that reference is made would distinguish whether they are being referred to as a Ranger for their completion of the school or for being a member of the Special Operating Force, 75th Ranger Regiment.' Crucially, serving as a Ranger qualified officer in a non-Ranger regiment is not, Spencer told us, the same as 'serving as a Ranger' in a conflict. Cotton's statement that his service abroad was 'as an Army Ranger' falsely implies service in the Special Operating Force, 75th Ranger Regiment. This was our argument in the original piece, and it is why our rating remains unchanged. 'Ranger qualified officers who served in other units do not describe their service 'as a Ranger,'' Spencer told us. The statement that someone 'served 'as a U.S. Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan' would only be used to discuss a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment. In my 25 years of military service I have never heard of a ranger qualified soldier being referred to in a statement about military service using Ranger unless in a ranger unit,' he said. Our original fact check, with corrected statements on which individuals can call themselves Rangers, appears below: On Jan. 23, 2021, Salon published an expose accusing Sen. Tom Cotton of overstating his military experience during past political campaigns in claiming that he was 'a U.S. Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan.' Cotton is, indeed, a military veteran with combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, but he was not an Army Ranger when he served in those conflicts. Cotton did complete a two-month Army Ranger training program, allowing him to be termed 'Ranger qualified' and put a Ranger 'tab' on his uniform. Such a training program, however, is not the same as serving in a conflict as an Army Ranger. Serving 'as' a Ranger implies service with an elite set of troops 'who served with the 75th Ranger Regiment based out of Fort Benning, Georgia,' to Military.com. Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post fact-checker, wrote about the difference between the two statuses in a July 2020 article: Simply put, there's the Ranger School, and there's the Ranger Regiment, a Special Operations unit. Anyone in the military can attend the Ranger School, whether or not they served in the Ranger Regiment. The Ranger School is an intense 62-day small-unit tactics course for dismounted infantry that only about 40 percent manage to complete. If a soldier makes it through the course, he or she earns the right to wear a uniform 'tab' - a small cloth arch - that reads 'Ranger.' In response to the Salon article, a Cotton spokesperson told Business Insider that 'To be clear, as he's stated many times, Senator Cotton graduated from Ranger School, earned the Ranger Tab, and served a combat tour with the 101st Airborne, not the 75th Ranger Regiment.' Several examples provided by Salon and others on social media, however, made it clear that Cotton had, at times, suggested that he served as an Army Ranger while in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is factually indefensible for Cotton to suggest he served as a Ranger during his tours of duty. And indeed, Cotton has explicitly made such a claim on more than one occasion. As Salon reported, Cotton told the Hot Springs Sentinel-Record in February 2012 that his 'experience as a U.S. Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan and my experience in business will put me in very good condition.' As highlighted on Twitter, Cotton made a similar claim in a 2014 ad for his Senate campaign, saying 'I made tough decisions as an Army Ranger in Iraq': In a 2014 campaign ad produced by Tom Cotton for Senate, Cotton claimed he 'made tough decisions as an Army Ranger in Iraq.' @cmclymer pic.twitter.com/0uTIkCHVv1 - Jeff Nichols (@backwards_river) January 23, 2021 Although other examples exist in which Cotton does not explicitly make the argument that he served as a Ranger during his tours of duty, the ones that do make that claim are undisputedly false, as Cotton never served in Iraq or Afghanistan with the 75th Ranger Regiment. Because Cotton nevertheless implied or asserted that he did, the accusation he misstated his military history is here rated 'True.'Recent Updates UPDATE [Feb. 2, 2021]: Clarified statements about Ranger terminology; Added commentary from Maj.

That's wrong. If anything, Republican leaders have taken great criticism for the continued efforts to dig into the results of an election that has already seen a recount and numerous legal challenges. Republicans have gone so far as to say they will use taxpayer money to pay a former state Supreme Court justice to oversee an effort led by retired police officers, also to be paid by taxpayers. Critics may say that effort is a ridiculous exercise. But our focus here is on Trump, and his claim Republican leaders have failed him and are doing nothing to examine the election results. That's plainly ridiculous. Pants on Fire.","President Joe Biden won Wisconsin nearly eight months ago, but the 2020 election in the state -- or at least the questioning of it -- seems to be never ending. Shortly after Biden won the state by more than 20,000 votes, thanks largely to Dane and Milwaukee counties, which both had large numbers of absentee ballots, President Donald Trump' campaign pursued a recount in those two counties. But that effort only shifted the margin by 87 votes toward Biden. Additionally seven lawsuits challenging aspects of the election have all failed, including at the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court and no evidence of widespread fraud has surfaced. Trump, of course, continues to claim he won the state. On the eve of the state GOP convention, Trump lashed out against three Republican state lawmakers -- Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, state Sen. Chris Kapenga and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu -- alleging that the trio was 'are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin.' The June 25, 2021 statement from Trump's Save America PAC went on to say: 'They are actively trying to prevent a Forensic Audit of the election results, especially those which took place in Milwaukee, one of the most corrupt election locales in the country. Don't fall for their lies! These REPUBLICAN 'leaders' need to step up and support the people who elected them by providing them a full forensic investigation.' So is Trump right? Are Vos, Kapenga and LeMahieu trying to prevent further audits and examinations, and to 'cover up election corruption'? In a word: No. Quite the opposite, actually. Republicans have called for several investigations into election results. Despite the failed recount, the many lawsuits, agreement that the Wisconsin election was free and fair and no evidence of enough fraud to overturn the result, Republicans are -- contrary to Trump's claim -- continuing to investigate. Vos, of Rochester, hired retired police officers to look into aspects of the election, according to a May 26, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. As a part of the effort, Vos said the former officers will review all tips received about election fraud and look into the credible ones, and will be paid with taxpayer funds. The team will also spend time looking into claims of double voting, as well as review how some clerks, following State Election Commission guidance, filled out some missing elements of absentee ballot applications. Also underway is an audit of the election by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau, which began in February, according to a Feb. 11, 2021 report from the Journal Sentinel. Requested by Republican lawmakers, the audit will look at issues that have faced scrutiny from courts and election observers, such as how the state maintains its voter rolls and when it allows voters to get absentee ballots without showing an ID. Meanwhile, in June, a group of Republican lawmakers, including state Rep. Janel Brandtjen of Menomonee Falls, head of the Assembly's elections committee, visited Arizona to tour the coliseum where a months-long review of Maricopa County's ballots is underway by order of Republicans in the Arizona Senate, according to a June 18, 2021 Journal Sentinel article. The Republican leaders targeted by Trump have dismissed the former president's claim as 'misinformed,' according to a June 26, 2021 Journal Sentinel report. 'When I saw the president's statement, it surprised me because many on the left have been going after us harder than I have ever seen, because in Wisconsin, we have hired investigators, we have passed legislation and we are doing a forensic audit already,' Vos said. 'So I think this is one of those cases where the president was just misinformed by his staff or he didn't see the media reports.' At the convention, Vos also announced that former conservative Supreme Court Justice Mike Gableman would oversee the former officers during their investigation. Gabelman will be paid at taxpayer expense. But what of Trump's assertion that Wisconsin legislators are refusing a 'forensic' audit? Communications staff for Trump did not respond to a request for more information on what he meant by a forensic audit, but a June 1, 2021 report by AZ Central said such an audit is one that investigates to find instances of fraud. That is, findings from the investigation can then be used as evidence in court later on. It wouldn't be off base to think the GOP-backed effort in Wisconsin -- involving retired police officers and a former Supreme Court justice -- would take such an approach. That said, the investigation method here may look different from what is happening as a part of Arizona's 'forensic' audit, where ballots and machines are being looked at.",,,,Says Republican leaders 'are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin.,refuted,pants-fire,"<p>One is being conducted by a former conservative state Supreme Court justice and a team of retired police officers, while another is being conducted by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau</p>",politifact

In addition to wrapping the album in a pink pair of panties, Cooper's 'School's Out' album also folded out into a small desk. In 2018, Braun told LongLiveVinyl.com that he tried to make the desk feel real by including images of the desk's contents, such as report cards, marbles, gum, and some student graffiti: I think this caught people off guard, as it opens into a real desk with legs, inkwell, pencil grooves, etc ... I carved initials and stuff in the wood of an antique desk I had someone source in downtown NYC and then my staff put boogers and chewing gum on there. Then I wrapped the record in a pair of women's panties over the vinyl. A woman gave me a pair of her undies, so I thought they might look great wrapped around the vinyl: the album 'wearing' panties. While this album was initially released wrapped in a pair of panties, U.S. Customs officials seized nearly 500,000 copies of the album after finding that the panties fell in violation of the Flammable Fabric Act. 19 Jun 1972, Mon The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, North Carolina) Newspapers.com It's unclear how many of these albums were sold with the original paper panties dust jacket. Ashley Pandel, an official with a firm that represented Cooper, said in 1972 that about 250,000 albums packaged with the panties were sent out for distribution before the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) intervened. Pandel also noted that the record company could circumvent the ban by applying a flame retardant spray to the panties. Despite thousands of records being seized, Cooper found the ban to be beneficial. In Cooper's biography, 'Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock 'n' Roller's Life and 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict,' the rock star writes: The School's Out album was an example of fun and excessive packaging. We worked with a group of graphic artists who did all of our album covers. Those guys were a lot like us. We worked well together, throwing out ideas. What if a kid lifted up his desk on Monday after the weekend What would he find? What if he produced a pair of panties? Then he was the guy! What else might be inside the desk? A switchblade? Notebooks? I have an idea. 'Let's wrap the next record inside a pair of pink panties instead of a dust cover.' A typical Alice Cooper formula: Kids will love it; parents will hate it. The entire concept changed: The album cover would transform into a desk that would actually unfold so you could open it. We scratched our own names into this desk that they would take a picture of it for the cover. The original carved desk now lives in a Hard Rock Cafe ... Warner's Bros. released 'School's Out' in July of 1972, right after school was out. You couldn't buy the kind of publicity we received. The album was soon banned. Why? The panties the record was wrapped in didn't conform to Federal Trade Commission standards - they weren't fireproof! Of course, my response was 'Who would be lighting a cigarette or a match down there anyway?' So now we had 100,000 pairs of pink, white, or blue paper panties wrapped around the first pressings of 'School's Out' albums that were considered a fire hazard by the U.S. government. Today the album pressing with the panties are collectibles on Goldmine and eBay. Sometimes the best thing is to get banned.

Jeremy Fresques, a Farmington native and Farmington High School graduate, joined a growing list of New Mexicans who have died in the war on terrorism, when the surveillance plane in which he flew crashed last week 80 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three of his U.S. colleagues and an Iraqi airman also were killed. Fresques was awarded the Bronze Medal posthumously Friday. Fresques was 26. He left behind a wife - also an Air Force captain - and his parents. His sacrifice - and theirs - in the name of our nation's security and the cause of democracy was immense. Col. O.G. Mannon, commander of the 16th Special Operations Wing, rightly called Fresques and his comrades 'heroes.' We regard Fresques and all men and women with New Mexico connections as family and hold them deeply in our hearts.1Capt. Fresques was killed in the line of duty on Memorial Day 2005, a month before he was to return home, and news of his death was conveyedthat day to Lt. Col. Scott Pleus, commander of the 63rd Fighter Squadron at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Arizona, where Capt. Fresques had previously been stationed. Lt. Col. Pleus, along with a chaplain and a medical technician, drove that evening to Yuma, Arizona, to undertake the sad duty of notifying Capt. Fresques' parents of their loss.About a week later, Lt. Col. Pleus was notified that a memorial service would be held for Capt. Fresques in Sun City, Arizona, on 15 June and that a fly-by from Luke AFB had been requested as part of the service in Capt. Fresques' honor. Lt. Col. Pleus quickly assented:Of course we would do it. It's a four-ship formation. They fly straight and level over the gravesite and then, directly over the service, the No. 3 plane pulls away while the others fly straight ahead. Symbolically he's headed for heaven. It's the highest form of respect we can pay to a fallen airman. Everyone involved in such a service considers it an honor. The fliers. The honor guard. The bugler who plays taps. All of us.2While preparing to head from Glendale to Sun City (a distance of about 6 miles) for the memorial service, four F-16 fighter jets from Luke AFB flew a holding pattern over Glendale's Arrowhead Mall, prompting a local resident unaware of their purpose to send a sarcastic letter of complaint to the editor of The Arizona Republic:A letter to the Editor; Question of the day for Luke Air Force Base: Whom do we thank for the morning air show? Last Wednesday, at precisely 9:11 a.m., a tight formation of four F-16 jets made a low pass over Arrowhead Mall, continuing west over Bell Road at approximately 500 feet. Imagine our good fortune! Do the Tom Cruise-wannabes feel we need this wake-up call, or were they trying to impress the cashiers at Mervyns' early-bird special? Any response would be appreciated. Tom MacRae, Peoria3The correspondent received a response from Col. Robin Rand, commander of Luke AFB's 56th Fighter Wing, in the pages of that same newspaper the following day:Luke Air Force Base was asked to respond to a letter writer's question about a 'morning air show' he observed recently ('A wake-up call from Luke's jets,' Letters, Thursday): The 'wake-up call' witnessed the morning of June 15 was a formation of F-16 jets from Luke Air Force Base lining up for a memorial service in Sun City at the gravesite for Air Force Capt. Jeremy Fresques, an officer assigned to Air Force Special Operations. Fresques gave his life in defense of our country while serving in Iraq. It is unfortunate that at a time when our nation is at war someone would believe we have less than honorable and professional reasons for such a mission. The commander of the fighter squadron was given the difficult duty of informing the family of Capt. Fresques on Memorial Day that the officer, a husband, son and Arizonan, had died in Iraq. On behalf of the men and women at Luke Air Force Base, we continue to keep Jeremy and his family in our thoughts and prayers. Col. Robin Rand Luke Air Force Base4Four days later, the newspaper also published a response from Lt. Col. Pleus himself:Regarding 'A wake-up call from Luke's jets': On June 15, at precisely 9:12 a.m., a perfectly timed four-ship of F-16s from the 63rd Fighter Squadron at Luke Air Force Base flew over the grave of Capt Jeremy Fresques. Capt. Fresques was an Air Force officer who was previously stationed at Luke Air Force Base and was killed in Iraq on May 30, Memorial Day. At 9 a.m. on June 15, his family and friends gathered at Sunland Memorial Park in Sun City to mourn the loss of a husband, son and friend. Based on the letter writer's recount of the flyby, and because of the jet noise, I'm sure you didn't hear the 21-gun salute, the playing of taps, or my words to the widow and parents of Capt. Fresques as I gave them their son's flag on behalf of the president of the United States and all those veterans and servicemen and women who understand the sacrifices they have endured. A four-ship flyby is a display of respect the Air Force pays to those who give their lives in defense of freedom. We are professional aviators and take our jobs seriously, and on June 15 what the letter writer witnessed was four officers lining up to pay their ultimate respects. The letter writer asks, 'Whom do we thank for the morning air show?' The 56th Fighter Wing will call for you, and forward your thanks to the widow and parents of Capt. Fresques, and thank them for you, for it was in their honor that my pilots flew the most honorable formation of their lives. Lt. Col. Scott Pleus Luke Air Force Base5To his credit, the complainant, Mr. MacRae, tendered a written apology which was published in The Republic on 9 July:Regarding 'Flyby honoring fallen comrade' (Letters, June 28): I read with increasing embarrassment and humility the response to my unfortunate letter to The Republic concerning an Air Force flyby ('A wake-up call from Luke's jets,' Letters, June 23). I had no idea of the significance of the flyby, and would never have insulted such a fine and respectful display had I known. I have received many calls from the fine airmen who are serving or have served at Luke, and I have attempted to explain my side and apologized for any discomfort my letter has caused. This was simply an uninformed citizen complaining about noise. I have been made aware in both written and verbal communications of the four-ship flyby, and my heart goes out to each and every lost serviceman and woman in this war in which we are engaged. I have been called un-American by an unknown caller and I feel that I must address that. I served in the U.S. Navy and am a Vietnam veteran. I love my country and respect the jobs that the service organizations are doing. Please accept my heartfelt apologies.

20648,9114,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sadiq-khan-video/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"After a 3 June 2017 attack in London, rumors began circulating almost immediately on social media attempting to smear London mayor Sadiq Khan (a Muslim man) for purportedly 'defending' September 11th terrorists. The claim often appears by itself, providing little to no context to describe how Khan might have 'defended' them: A popular Facebook version included a video and status update: Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was the lawyer for a 9/11 terrorist and has family links to extremist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. This guy is now in charge of keeping London safe from those extremist organisations?!? Khan Has Been Affiliated With Organizations Tied To Hamas, Al-Qaeda, Al Nusra, ISIS And The Muslim Brotherhood. In 2004 he appeared on a platform with five Islamic extremists at a conference in London organised by Al-Aqsa, a group that has published works by the notorious Holocaust denier Paul Eisen. Some versions of the claim held, in part, that Khan represented terrorists as a lawyer - specifically individuals involved in the planning and execution of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Footage of Sadiq Khan in 2001 as the lawyer and what he said on the 9/11/2001 terrorist attack. In the circulating clip Khan referenced 'three British men', which should have been a primary clue that it did not have anything to do with the 2001 hijackers. Some versions of this rumor claimed he defended Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen (about whom Khan was clearly not speaking in the video). Moussaoui was one of several people sometimes described as the '20th hijacker,' charged and convicted as a conspirator in the attacks in the United States. That claim appeared first in 2016, at which time the Guardian reported Khan's firm did not represent Moussaoui but consulted on his defense. However, that particular video has nothing to do with Khan's purported defense of Moussaoui, or anyone else linked to the 11 September 2001 hijackers or co-conspirators. Khan did not 'defend' Moussaoui (either verbally or in any legal capacity), and the circulating clip was unrelated to claims linking London's mayor to the tragedy. Instead, it dates back to the April 2002 arrests of three British men in Cairo: The Foreign Office minister Lady Symons has told three Britons jailed in Egypt for more than a year - allegedly for Islamist views and trying to overthrow the state - that she believes their confessions were extracted 'under duress'. In an unusually strongly worded statement, the minister responsible for the Middle East expressed frustration at trial delays and raised serious doubts about the integrity of the Egyptian legal process. Ian Nisbet, Reza Pankhurst and Maajid Nawaz, all from London, have been held in custody since April 2002. They maintain they were tortured by police into signing fictitious confessions. Their trial is to resume in Cairo today. Another statement, released by their families in London yesterday, from Britain's consul in Cairo, Gordon Brown, says he had 'noted slight bruising on the nose and eyes of Reza Pankhurst' when he visited the men 10 days after their arrest. The erroneous constellation of rumors were not the first attempt to link Mayor Sadiq Khan to the 9/11 attacks. In May 2016, British tabloid the Mirror reported that the far-right nationalist group Britain First attempted to spread similar claims on social media. ",Did London Mayor Sadiq Khan Defend 9/11 Terrorists? Rumors that Sadiq Khan defended 11 September 2001 terrorists were spread alongside an unrelated video following June 2017 attacks in London.

19277,7271,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/keanu-reeves-tragedy-quote/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In November 2015, a Facebook fan page for actor Keanu Reeves posted the above-quoted message about some of the difficulties the actor has overcome during his life. While the original FB post has been deleted, copies of the quote are still circulating via social media, online forums and various web sites. While many of these postings attribute the quote directly to Keanu Reeves, the actor did not write the above-displayed passage. According to the group's disclaimer, the actor is in no way affiliated with the FB page: This is a Keanu Reeves Fan Page. We are not associated with the real Keanu Reeves in any way. We just quote what we read and spread positivity. While this Facebook page claims that they 'just quote what we read,' we have not been able to find any credible source attributing the above-displayed passage to Keanu Reeves. In fact, the above-displayed passage closely resembles a story published by Higher Perspectives entitled 'The Tragically Heartbreaking And Uplifting Life Of Keanu Reeves Revealed.' The one major difference is that the post published by the FB page was written in the first person (making it seem like it was written by Keanu Reeves) while the Higher Perspectives story was written about the actor: At the age of three, his father left their family. They stayed in touch for a few years, but after the divorce and moving from city to city, they fell out of contact. Keanu attended four different high schools and struggled with dyslexia, making his education more challenging than it is for most. Eventually he left high school without earning a diploma, though through sheer will, he is an avid reader now. At the age of 23, his closest friend River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. During a Reddit AMA last year, Keanu said: 'He was a remarkable human person and actor. We got along very well, and I miss him. I think of him often.' In 1998, Keanu met Jennifer Syme. The two fell instantly in love and by 1999, Jennifer was pregnant with their daughter. Sadly, after eight months, their child was born stillborn. They were devastated by her death and it eventually ended their relationship. 18 months later, Syme would die in a car accident. Even with those incredible tragedies, Reeves would push on. He's starred in a variety of blockbusters and has become a wealthy man, but the pain of his losses has changed how he thinks about money. He's well known in Hollywood for being among the more charitable actors. After the successes of The Matrix and its sequels, Reeves gave $80 million of his $114 million earnings to the special effects and makeup staff of the films. He also took pay cuts on the films The Replacements and The Devil's Advocates so stars like Gene Hackman and Al Pacino would agree to be in the film while keeping casting within the designated budget. So in the end, I think we can all pretty well agree that even in the face of tragedy, a stellar person can thrive. While the above-displayed story was not written by the actor, it does tell a 'mostly true' story about Keanu Reeves' life.",Quoth Keanu?

28945,105141,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/sep/05/jd-wooten/wooten-says-blocked-medicaid-affected-half-million/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling In the caption of a video posted to Facebook, Wooten said, 'My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid - costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans.' Wooten is mostly correct on the first two charges and close to correct on the third. Gunn co-sponsored a 2013 bill that rejected Medicaid expansion, so even if he was not solely responsible for blocking expansion, he played a role in it. Experts agree this is costing approximately 500,000 North Carolinians the chance at receiving health coverage. That would include many veterans, although the exact number is less clear than Wooten suggested. But given the available research, Wooten's number seems reasonable. We rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters' Lab and PolitiFact. The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provides support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide. Share the Facts 2018-09-06 13:35:38 UTC PolitiFact 5 1 7 PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid - costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans. JD Wooten NC Senate Candidate Facebook AD North Carolina Friday, August 24, 2018 2018-08-24 Read More info","For years, Democrats in North Carolina have pushed to expand Medicaid, a move they say would help hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians afford health insurance. JD Wooten, A Democratic candidate for state Senate, added new fuel to the expansion debate when he blasted his opponent, four-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rick Gunn, in a campaign ad. 'My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid - costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,' Wooten said in a caption posted with the video. We wondered if Wooten -- who is running in North Carolina's District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County -- was correct in his estimates. We decided to take a look. 'Blocked the expansion' Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income people. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970 but remains one of 17 states that has not moved to expand it. Medicaid expansion - an action made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act - would give coverage to folks with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, many North Carolinians who do not qualify for the ACA's health care subsidies or regular Medicaid coverage would be able to escape the so-called coverage gap. Since his election in 2016, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has battled with conservatives in the state's Republican-led legislature over the issue. There were signs of a bipartisan agreement when Republicans authored a 2017 bill called 'Carolina Cares,' but the legislation never got off the ground in committee. But while some state Republicans have worked toward compromise, Gunn was among many co-sponsors of a 2013 bill that rejected the ACA's optional Medicaid expansion, clarified the state's intent not to operate a state-run health benefit exchange and determined that Medicaid eligibility decisions would be made by the state rather than the federal government. The bill was adopted by a vote of 74 to 40 in the state House and 31-16 in the state Senate and signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. Gunn did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Republican leaders in the legislature have consistently opposed Medicaid expansion, saying North Carolina's share of the rising cost of the program would be too expensive. Senate leader Phil Berger called it a 'budget-busting' expense, The News & Observer reported in 2017. 'Half a million people' The Wooten campaign cited several reports to support the claim that withholding Medicaid expansion was costing half a million North Carolinians health insurance. Among those were articles from the left-leaning North Carolina Justice Center, the pro-expansion Close the Gap NC and the North Carolina Medical Journal, all of which estimated that the expanded benefit would give new coverage to some 500,000 people. Most other reports predicted similar results. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, estimated in 2016 that there are more than 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University's Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the actual impact would likely exceed the Census Bureau's estimate because additional people who are currently insured on ACA exchanges could be expected to transfer to Medicaid if an expansion bill passed. 'The estimate of 500,000 North Carolina residents would be covered by Medicaid is a solid estimate well within consensus, expert opinion,' Anderson said. Other experts we consulted agreed. 'It appears that about a half a million people is close in the estimate,' said Lisa Dubay, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning, Washington-based think tank. Predictions and estimates vary, but Wooten's claim does not seem to oversell the impact Medicaid expansion could have. In a 2017 article, North Carolina Health News reported that the number could even exceed 625,000, according to the state's Medical Care Advising Committee, a collection of health clinic managers, doctors and administrators. Veterans affected The Wooten campaign did not say how or where it found its estimate for the impact on veterans, but the number may have come from NC Policy Watch, the news arm of the NC Justice Center, which cited a 2013 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. According to that study, approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans would receive Medicaid coverage under an expanded program. Anderson noted, however, that although the estimate resulted from a sound statistical process, it is becoming outdated. Jennifer Haley, a research associate in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who co-authored the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study, also directed us to a more recent report issued by the Urban Institute in 2016. That report estimated that, of the 25,000 veterans projected to be uninsured in North Carolina in 2017, 2,000 would be eligible for but not receiving Medicaid and another 12,000 would fall into the coverage gap, for a total of approximately 14,000 people. This number is short of Wooten's 23,000, but Anderson explained that the difference between the two studies' findings is likely due to sampling error and trend changes. 'The caveat with Medicaid expansion is that current veterans who make between 100 and 138 percent (of the federal poverty level) would be able to switch their insurance to Medicaid or gain coverage,' Anderson said. 'There are no good numbers for that. I think it is safe to say that the most recent study gives a floor of 14,000.' So Wooten's estimate may be outdated, but it does not seem unreasonable. And his larger point - that a large number of veterans would gain coverage from Medicaid expansion - holds true.",,,,"'My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid - costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact
7620,9644,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tresemme-shampoo-lawsuit/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In December 2020, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers asking us to examine the accuracy of reports and social media posts that claimed users of two variants of TRESemmé shampoo had filed a class-action lawsuit against the manufacturer, Unilever, over the alleged inclusion of an ingredient that causes hair loss. On Dec. 3, Facebook user Shevelle Finney recounted her alleged experience of hair loss in a post that was shared more than 250,000 times. She wrote: ...I have very long thick curly hair that is now half the thickness it was this time last year. It has been falling out by the brush full and in the shower. I just chalked it up to the stress. I've used Tresemme shampoo for years it's the only thing that tames my hair. Well guess what... I got a phone call from my mother tonight telling me to stop using it. She just got an email about a new class action lawsuit against Tresemme shampoo for having ingredients in it that make your hair fall out. Internet users also inquired about a Nov. 17 article on the website ClassAction.org, that reported the following: A proposed class action filed this week claims the makers of the TRESemmé Keratin Smooth line of shampoos failed to warn users that an ingredient in the products can cause significant hair loss and scalp irritation. According to the 49-page case, TRESemmé Keratin Hair Smoothing Shampoo and TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Color Shampoo, made by defendants Unilever United States, Inc. and Conopco, Inc., contain a preservative called DMDM hydantoin, which is known to leach formaldehyde when it comes into contact with water. Given formaldehyde is a 'well-known human carcinogen' that can cause cancer and other harmful reactions when absorbed into the skin, Unilever's use of DMDM hydantoin in the TRESemmé Keratin Smooth products is 'an entirely unnecessary risk' since safer and natural alternatives exist, the lawsuit argues. Nevertheless, the suit alleges, the defendants have failed to properly warn consumers of the risks associated with using such a strong chemical on their hair and have even gone so far as to claim the TRESemmé Keratin Smooth products are safe. The website TopClassActions.com published a similar article. Setting aside Finney's descriptions of her own personal experience, which we're not in a position to assess, those accounts were accurate in their descriptions of the lawsuit in question. On Nov. 16, 2020, Illinois woman Emily Castillo filed a lawsuit against Unilever USA and its subsidiary Conopco, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on behalf of herself and 'other similarly situated consumers.' In her complaint, Castillo alleged that: Two products (TRESemmé Keratin Hair Smoothing Shampoo and TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Color Shampoo) contain DMDM hydantoin, a preservative known to release formaldehyde, which is a known carcinogen, and the products' use of DMDM hydantoin can cause or contribute to hair loss and scalp irritation. Unilever has been aware of those facts since 2012 Unilever failed to properly warn consumers about the risks associated with the products' use of DMDM hydantoin. As a result, Castillo argued, the defendants had committed consumer fraud, breach of warranty, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. According to her complaint, the number of would-be participants in the class action lawsuit could be 'thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,' and she asked the court to order a recall of the products, as well as to instruct Unilever and Conopco to pay unspecified amounts in restitution, damages, attorneys' fees and other costs. Unilever has not yet filed a response to the allegations contained in the complaint, and has until February 2021 to do so. Snopes invited the company to answer Castillo's allegations, but we did not receive any reply in time for publication. In her widely-shared Facebook post, Finney included a photograph of a bottle of TRESemmé Moisture Rich conditioner. It's not clear whether that photograph was for illustration purposes only, or indicates that it is the only TRESemmé product she uses, and therefore one which she alleges caused her hair to fall out. (The text of Finney's post referred to TRESemmé shampoo, but the photograph showed a bottle of conditioner.) That particular conditioner does contain DMDM hydantoin, the ingredient at the center of Castillo's lawsuit, but it is not one of the two specific TRESemmé shampoo variants cited in the complaint.","Did Consumers Sue Over Alleged Hair Loss Ingredient in TRESemmé Shampoo?

Davis, a Fort Myers Beach accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for firing two employees. Darlene Smiley and Cynthia Fellows claimed that they were terminated for speaking up about not getting paid overtime. Davis paid overtime during tax season -- roughly January to April -- but offered only compensation time the rest of the year, Smiley and Fellows said. When Smiley asked Davis to pay her the money she was entitled in the fall of 1986, Davis refused. So Smiley complained to the Department of Labor. Investigators interviewed both Smiley and Fellows and determined Davis needed to pay. He did, and then promptly fired both Smiley and Fellows. In court, the Labor Department claimed that Davis violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and argued that the two women should be offered their jobs back. Davis, through his attorney Kottkamp, said that while the overtime controversy was one of the reasons Smiley and Fellows were fired, they would have been fired anyway, because of poor work habits and poor work product. In a 1993 ruling, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida sided with Davis, saying that Smiley and Fellows were not fired because they complained about the overtime. The district court's ruling actually was vacated on appeal in 1995 because the appellate court determined that the complaints were a reason the women were fired. But the appellate court said that as long the complaints were not the only reason, Davis acted lawfully. The case returned to district court and quickly was dismissed, giving Kottkamp the victory he claims over the feds. Kottkamp said during a televised debate that he has taken on the federal government as a lawyer and won. In the 1990s, Kottkamp represented an accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. Kottkamp successfully argued that the man fired two employees legally. For that, we rate his claim True.","Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican running for attorney general, is trying to push back against criticisms that he's a politician first and lawyer second by highlighting his success in the courtroom. At a July 31, 2010, debate with GOP rivals Holly Benson and Pam Bondi, Kottkamp said that he'd put his legal experience up against anyone running. Then he offered his proof. 'I've taken on the federal government,' Kottkamp said. 'And won.' We wanted to see if Kottkamp is accurately describing his legal career. According to the Florida Constitution, the state attorney general must have been a member of the bar of Florida for the preceding five years. That's a standard Kottkamp must, and does, meet. Kottkamp attended the University of Florida College of Law and received his Juris Doctor degree in 1987. He clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Joe Eaton and U.S. District Court Judge Sidney Aronovitz. From 1991-2005, he was a shareholder in the Fort Myers firm of Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt, and before becoming lieutenant governor, he spent a brief time as a partner at Morgan & Morgan. Kottkamp remains a member in good standing with the Florida Bar. Kottkamp's campaign pointed us to case from the 1990s to back up his claim. What follows is an account cobbled together from court documents of the case, Robert B. Reich vs. John C. Davis, P.A. In that case Kottkamp represented John C. Davis, a Fort Myers Beach accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for firing two employees. Darlene Smiley and Cynthia Fellows claimed that they were terminated for speaking up about not getting paid overtime. Davis paid overtime during tax season -- roughly January to April -- but offered only compensation time the rest of the year, Smiley and Fellows said. When Smiley asked Davis to pay her the money she was entitled in the fall of 1986, Davis refused. So Smiley complained to the Department of Labor. Investigators interviewed both Smiley and Fellows and determined Davis needed to pay. He did, and then promptly fired both Smiley and Fellows. In court, the Labor Department claimed that Davis violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and argued that the two women should be offered their jobs back. Davis, through his attorney Kottkamp, said that while the overtime controversy was one of the reasons Smiley and Fellows were fired, they would have been fired anyway, because of poor work habits and poor work product. In a 1993 ruling, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida sided with Davis, saying that Smiley and Fellows were not fired because they complained about the overtime. The district court's ruling actually was vacated on appeal in 1995 because the appellate court determined that the complaints were a reason the women were fired. But the appellate court said that as long the complaints were not the only reason, Davis acted lawfully. The case returned to district court and quickly was dismissed, giving Kottkamp the victory he claims over the feds. Kottkamp said during a televised debate that he has taken on the federal government as a lawyer and won. In the 1990s, Kottkamp represented an accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. Kottkamp successfully argued that the man fired two employees legally. For that, we rate his claim True.",,,,'I've taken on the federal government and won.,supported,true,,politifact
14652,1764,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sanders-campaign-busing-youths-to-caucuses-and-primaries/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"As Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders racked up impressive late-March 2016 primary and caucus wins across three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington) in one day, his success prompted renewed interest in an older social media rumor claiming that his support had been bolstered through the tactic of busing large numbers of youngsters' in from out of state to 'crowd out legitimate voters.' News reporting on March 2016 primaries and caucuses often focused on massive voter turnout in some states, a phenomenon that led to hours-long lines at the polls and ballot shortages. But rumors claiming the Sanders campaign deliberately bused disruptive youngsters to those events didn't originate with candidate's March 2016 wins - two months earlier, Sanders had become visibly annoyed when a question on that subject was posed to him by editor Al Hunt at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast in Des Moines: In the heated exchange captured in the above above, Hunt appeared to suppress amusement as he posed a question that included reference to 'out-of-state young people' showing up at caucuses: The Clinton people say that they are, in places like Ames and Iowa City, that they are very worried that a number of out-of-state young people may try to show up to the caucus and they're going to make a major effort to make sure that that's not the case. Hunt didn't include any qualification for the question, such as evidence uncovered by Bloomberg Politics (or anyone else) that the Sanders campaign had actually engaged in any disruptive busing efforts. Other reporting from that news outlet suggested the same claim had been levied by Clinton supporters against Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential contest. Evidence of the same accusation being lobbed at Obama remains on a few sites, including Politico, where a December 2007 blog item quotes a Clinton campaign spokesman as saying: There's a big difference here. We are not systematically trying to manipulate the Iowa caucuses with out of state people. We don't have literature recruiting out of state college students. We didn't bus in folks from out of state to the [Jefferson-Jackson dinner]. We didn't bring in out of state activists to the Heartland Forum. A visibly agitated Sanders replied to Hunt's suggestion that his campaign was engaging in the same sort of manipulation that the Obama campaign had been accused of by Clintonites back in 2008: Really? Is that what they're saying? You know I am, this is ... You talk about negative stuff ... Really? Based on what do they say that? Based on David Brock's long history of honest and integrity? The man who tried to destroy Anita Hill? Is that where this is coming from? Everyone of you know, you know it, that every day you're being flooded by all this negative stuff from Sec. Clinton's super PAC. I haven't heard of that. I don't want my integrity and honesty to be impugned. I have no idea who says this, that is a lie. An absolute lie. We will win or lose, we do it honestly, and I really dislike people suggesting we're going to bring in students from out of state who are going to perjure themselves, and say they are from Iowa? That's, talk about negative stuff, this is what ... Again, I don't think this is the Secretary ... but you bring people like David Brock ... into your campaign ... if this is the kinda stuff that they're planting, that's negative stuff. Sanders referenced David Brock, whose role in the Clinton's 2016 campaign was described thusly by the Los Angeles Times: Brock guides a network of pro-Clinton 'super PACs,' mega-donors and opposition researchers that operates outside the confines of federal restrictions on campaign spending. At the center is Media Matters, his decade-old nonprofit group that meticulously monitors and counters conservative media, political attacks on liberal politicians and - more recently - unflattering stories about Clinton in the mainstream press. Sanders also referenced Brock's admitted involvement in the deliberate smearing of Anita Hill, who testified during Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991 that Thomas had sexually harassed her while he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the EEOC: The author of a best-selling book that attacked the credibility of Anita F. Hill has disavowed its premise, and now says that he lied in print to protect the reputation of Justice Clarence Thomas. David Brock, the author of the book, 'The Real Anita Hill,' has also suggested [in a magazine article] that Justice Thomas used an intermediary to provide Mr. Brock with damaging information about a woman who had come forward to provide support for Ms. Hill's accusations of harassment by Justice Thomas ... Brock reported that he then used the information to force the woman to retract her statements about Justice Thomas. The article, in the August issue of Talk magazine, is excerpted from Mr. Brock's new book, 'Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex Conservative.' Describing an article he wrote for The American Spectator, a conservative magazine, in 1992, which became the basis for his book on Ms. Hill, he said he did everything he could to 'ruin Hill's credibility,' using 'virtually every derogatory and often contradictory allegation I had collected on Hill into the vituperative mix.' ... Mr. Brock wrote that he used the information to intimidate her into recanting her account, threatening that he would 'blacken her name, just as I had done to every other woman who had impugned Thomas's reputation.' A pair of items published in the New York Times in late January 2016 possibly fed the 'disruptive busing' rumors. On 24 January 2016 that newspaper reported that the 'Bernie Sanders youth brigade' was on the move, and the campaign was planning to transport Iowa college students back to their hometowns so the youngsters could participate in the state's caucuses: With the Iowa caucuses just over a week away, the Bernie Sanders youth brigade is on the move. Seven hundred college-age volunteers from across the Midwest and as far away as California are streaming into Iowa to help get the vote out. Organizers on Iowa campuses are reserving rooms to turn into phone bank centers, distributing campaign-provided toe warmers to the foot soldiers and playing Mr. Sanders's spoken-word version of 'This Land Is Your Land' to motivate them. Ahead of Feb. 1, the day Iowa voters finally have their say, the Sanders campaign is activating 'Go Home for Bernie,' a plan to dispatch a fleet of rental cars, vans and buses, if necessary, to carry students who are from Iowa back to their hometowns, where they will have maximum impact on the caucuses. A few days later, that same newspaper reported some uncertainty about how many of Sanders' Iowa supporters were actually registered to vote: It's common to talk about the turnout challenge facing Donald Trump, who clearly fares well among those who don't vote regularly. But the candidate with the biggest turnout challenge in this cycle is probably Bernie Sanders. Mr. Sanders appears to be extraordinarily dependent on turnout from infrequent voters, even more than Democrats have recently been in general elections, and maybe more than Barack Obama in the 2008 Iowa caucuses - mainly because his support is so strong among the young. The scale of Mr. Sanders's turnout challenge is unusually large. Compared with the supporters of Hillary Clinton, his are far less likely to report that they intend to vote; they have less history of voting; and they come from demographic categories who turn out in low numbers. This all adds considerable uncertainty to the pre-election polls, which always struggle to determine who is or is not likely to vote. There are even questions about how many of Mr. Sanders's supporters are actually registered to vote. He has not yet led in an Iowa poll that was conducted using data from voter registration files, the technique preferred by most campaigns but only occasionally used by media pollsters. All but one of the surveys using random digit dialing - a kind of poll that contacts all types of adults, including those who are unregistered - have shown a Sanders lead in the state. However, both pieces described the need for Sanders to ensure his Iowa supporters could participate in their hometown caucuses, not a plot to bring students in from outside Iowa to infiltrate the state caucuses and other politics events. We found no reports about the Iowa caucuses that addressed unregistered, out-of-state agitators having taken part in them, nor were we able to locate reports of any similar voter chicanery emerging in any states in which caucuses or primaries had thus far been conducted. Moreover, we found no such reports of organized travel among Sanders supporters on social media, despite the propensity of young people to catalog their exploits on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and the like. The apparently baseless claim wasn't even unique to presidential campaigning when Hunt presented it to an annoyed Sanders on 28 January 2016 - prior to that, similar rumors had circulated about spates of Black Lives Matter protests across the United States in 2014 and 2015 (again, with no substantive evidence any such collusion was underway). In March 2016, the same tale was repurposed as a narrative thread in the tapestry of rumors regarding protests at Donald Trump rallies. So rife was the belief that paid protesters were disrupting Trump rallies that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tweeted (and then deleted) a link to a fake news story purporting to support the rumor: Despite the enduring popularity of the rumor, we've never been able to find evidence (of which there should be a few social media traces) that Sanders (or anyone else) engaged students (or anyone else) to travel to sites and disrupt or fraudulently participate in rallies, caucuses, or primaries.","Sanders Campaign Busing Youths to Caucuses and Primaries Social media rumors claimed Bernie Sanders bused youthful disruptors to rallies, caucuses, and primaries in order to crowd out rival 'legitimate' voters and participants.

In the final debate of the campaign, moderator Bob Scheiffer asked Romney, 'Where are you going to get the money?' Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget -- by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states. President Barack Obama said Romney's plan for more defense spending is a bad idea, because it isn't necessary. Romney 'wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for,' Obama said. In this fact-check, we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass don't want. Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that restoring the military 'will not be a cost-free process,' and said he will 'begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending - meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development - at a floor of 4 percent of GDP.' What's 4 percent worth? The Pentagon's budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate. In the past, when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times, the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4-percent goal will take some time to achieve. While the campaign website describes the goal as 'a floor', campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it 'a target' in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse 'Obama-era defense cuts.' In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, 'That's not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.'' This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney's part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that. What the Pentagon is asking for In the debate, Romney said, 'Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285.' In fact, the 313-ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review. In April, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships. Mabus's remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach. 'A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,' he said. The president's budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. His defense secretary, Leon Panetta, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military. 'We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020,' Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. 'We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time-to win any conflict, anywhere.' Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department's plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face. 'The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.,' Panetta told the budget committee. 'We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in.' Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said, 'the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts.' The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public. This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military, and by and large, the commanders support the plan. 'It's hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this,' Bensahel said. Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits.

We found that America gives more humanitarian aid than any other country, and it ranks first in supporting the UN's lead agency in helping refugees. While the numbers are a bit inexact, an expert we reached said all the numbers point toward the United States being the top donor. While other countries give more relative to the size of their economy, the total volume of dollars matters most in terms of being able to provide more food, shelter and medical care. However, countries that host refugees also provide humanitarian assistance in ways that are not so easily tallied. Those efforts should factor into an assessment of each nation's level of aid. Obama was likely thinking in terms of financial support and in that regard, his statement holds water. But it's important to acknowledge that other forms of assistance matter. The statement is largely correct but it requires a bit more information. We rate it Mostly True.","With nearly two dozen U.S. states now saying they won't resettle Syrian refugees, President Barack Obama took a moment during the G20 meeting to acknowledge the pressures faced by other countries at the gathering. 'The United States, as the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Turkey, Europe, and others in trying to help those who need help right now, even as we hope to reduce the flow of migrants because of the situation inside of Syria,' Obama said. We wanted to know if America in fact is the largest provider of aid for displaced people and refugees. If we simply look at the dollars spent on international assistance, the numbers largely back up Obama. (We asked the White House for comment but didn't hear back.) But the dollars don't tell the whole story. Any country that houses refugees incurs costs apart from its support for international aid agencies. The dollars Development Initiatives is a British organization focused on gathering data to help reduce global poverty. It reports that in 2012, the United States provided more humanitarian aid than any other nation. The U.S. government spent $3.8 billion, representing nearly a third of all aid from donor countries. The second highest donor was not a single country but agencies of the European Union with about $1.8 billion in humanitarian aid. From the Development Initiatives report, here are the top 10 donors in 2012: Donor Amount Share of total United States $3.8 billion 29.4% EU $1.88 billion 14.5% United Kingdom $1.16 billion 9.0% Turkey $1.03 billion 8.0% Sweden $784 million 6.1% Germany $757 million 5.9% Japan $606 million 4.7% Canada $512 million 4.0% Norway $509 million 3.9% Australia $442 million 3.4% The United States ranks first, but it also represents the largest national economy. As a percentage of Gross National Income (the research center's economic yardstick), Luxembourg and Sweden are the top donors giving 0.16 percent and 0.14 percent respectively. This table shows the line-up, again using Development Initiative data: We should note that these donations go toward problems that range beyond refugees and people displaced by conflict. This humanitarian aid also provides food when people are starving and shelter when a flood or other disaster drives them from their homes. To get a slightly different angle, we looked at the donors to the UN High Commission on Refugees. That's the UN lead agency for refugee assistance. Again, the United States comes out on top with $792 million given in 2012. The next highest was Japan. Susan Fratzke is a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a research center in New York City. Fratzke said the donor numbers only take you so far. 'Not all the refugee aid goes to the UNHCR,' Fratzke said. 'Some governments also give to big nonprofits, like the International Rescue Committee.' But Fratzke said specific to Syria, America has been the largest donor to help people fleeing that conflict. She said she's comfortable that all told, the United States most likely is the largest donor across the board. Hosting refugees There's another way to look at providing aid, though, and that's by looking at how many displaced persons are residing in a country. According to the UNHCR, in 2014 no country dealt with more refugees than Turkey. More than 1.5 million Syrians fled their war-torn country to find safety in Turkey.

The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can't get legally at all. ... Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. 'First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,' he said. 'However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We'd then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.' Donald Trump's new running mate also said, 'Basically, if I'd have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they'd do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it's not supposed to be like that ... And it gets worse - when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana's economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I'm telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,' Pence concluded. As with all content on Newslo (and its sister sites Religionlo and Politicalo), the item used a fact-based introduction to lead into counterfactual information. Pence did sign anti-abortion legislation in May 2016 but like all content published by that trio of fake news sites, the article included a 'show facts' or 'hide facts' button (all content displayed by default in 'hide facts' mode): While the facts of the first paragraph were broadly true (as Pence had signed an abortion bill a few months prior), the remainder of the piece was embellished or entirely fabricated. Pence never said that women would attempt to get raped in order to have an abortion, to obtain days off work or for other reasons. Newslo and its companion sites most commonly publish articles containing one paragraph of straightforward news and a balance of false information. Prior efforts from the outlets included reports Chris Christie said a female version of Viagra would lead to increased 'lesbianism' (and voted down a gender pay parity bill for Biblical reasons), an Alabama politician proposed saliva-based 'hunger tests' for food stamp recipients, Ted Cruz said the death of Antonin Scalia was suspiciously timed, and Pat Robertson claimed David Bowie was still alive after his death. ","Did Mike Pence Say 'Allowing Rape Victims to Have Abortions Will Lead to Women Trying to Get Raped'?

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In July 2021, unreliable sources reported that the security detail of French President Emanuel Macron had resigned en masse, in protest against COVID-19 vaccine passport requirements. On July 24, for example, the website of right-wing radio personality Hal Turner, a frequent source of misinformation in recent years, published an article with the headline: 'SHOCK! Protective Detail of France President ALL Resign over COVID Restrictions; will no longer protect President Macron.' The article asserted that: The Republican Guard, a security detail established to protect the President of France, have ALL resigned, and will no longer protect President Macron! The mass resignation comes on the heels of his Presidential Decree requiring French citizens to have and use a 'Sanitary Passport' (i.e. Vaccine Certificate) or be denied access to stores, bars, even DENIED VOTING! On July 26, TheBL.com (The Beauty of Life) posted a similar report, based on Turner's article. In 2019, a Snopes investigation revealed close links between TheBL.com and The Epoch Times, a controversial pro-Trump publication known for promulgating politically-motivated misinformation. Both articles cited initial remarks made by Martine Wonner, a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic and member of the French Assemblée Nationale (equivalent to the U.S. House of Representatives). The claim that the Republican Guard ('Garde républicaine') had resigned en masse over the impending introduction of vaccine passports in France was false. The article on Turner's website also inaccurately characterized that body as being Macron's personal security detail. The video of Wonner was taken from a July 22 interview she conducted for an anti-lockdown, COVID-19-skeptic Facebook group called Les Colères des Rues ('Anger on the Streets.') In it, Wonner railed against the COVID-19 mitigation policies introduced by Macron's centrist government and passed by the Senate and Assembly, in particular the 'pass sanitaire' - a health passport certifying full vaccination, recent recovery from COVID-19, or a negative COVID-19 test - which will be required in order to attend public venues and events. At one point in the interview, around 27 minutes in, Wonner claimed she had spoken with law enforcement officers who told her they had 'had enough,' and were 'on the side of the people' in opposing COVID-related restrictions. She added: You know the Republican Guard, who protect the president, Macron? They've quit. The Republican Guard no longer wishes to ensure the protection of the president. It's absolutely incredible. Of course, they've put in place a different protection set-up, but I mean, that is a highly symbolic message to send. It reassures the public, but also shows where we're at... In reality, the Republican Guard had not resigned. A spokesperson for the Gendarmerie Nationale - one of two branches of France's national police, and the one to which the Republican Guard reports - confirmed for the Agence France-Presse news agency that the body was continuing to perform its duties. According to the Republican Guard's website, those duties include: taking part in important state ceremonies and providing musical accompaniment; guarding and providing security at several prominent state buildings, including the Elysée Palace, the French president's official residence; providing ad hoc assistance to other law enforcement agencies; providing escorts to dignitaries and officials. While the Republican Guard does indirectly provide a measure of security for the president, through its guarding of the Elysée Palace, the body responsible specifically for the president's personal protection is the Groupe de sécurité de la Presidence de la République (GSPR), which is an agency of France's second national police force, the Police Nationale. We could find no official statement, social media post or reputable news report in France which supported the claim that either the Republican Guard or GSPR had abandoned their duties or were refusing to provide protection to Macron. Those glaring absences, in addition to the Gendarmerie Nationale spokesperson's refutation of Wonner's claims, means we are issuing a rating of 'False.'","No, French President Macron's Security Detail Did Not Quit Over COVID-19 Rules Right-wing American sources seized upon baseless claims made by a French politician, in July 2021.

Among the companies listed, only two of the CEOs resigned after the coronavirus outbreak and left their companies. One sold a large amount of his company stock after his resignation was announced - but while he was still with the company, and well after the outbreak had made news. We found no evidence of any effort to give advance information to the 14 CEOs so that they use it to profit personally. We rate the claim False.","In late March, several senators faced angry questions about stock sales they made in the days following an intelligence briefing on the coronavirus, and before spreading panic over the virus pummeled U.S. markets. Now there are suspicions online that certain powerful people were tipped off to the threat of the coronavirus in time to protect their finances. One Facebook post claims that after being tipped off by government officials, the chief executive officers of more than 14 major companies resigned in order to be able to sell stocks they owned. Here's the post: The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Among those listed, we did find two examples of departing CEOs selling company stock, but that was after the outbreak was publicly known, and both were still with their companies. There's no evidence of any coordinated effort by government officials to give 14 CEOs advance information about the coronavirus that they could use for personal profit. Reasons for resignations unclear CEOs can depart for any number of reasons, including normal succession planning, or moves by the board to shake up leadership. CEOs and companies don't always go public with all the reasons behind such departures. 'Just like politicians leaving to spend more time with their families, CEOs' actual reasons for departure are rarely described accurately,' corporate-governance expert Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, told PolitiFact. A public company is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to explain a CEO's departure only if the CEO resigned because of a disagreement with the company over operations, policies or practices, or if the CEO was removed for cause, said Douglas Chia, president of Soundboard Governance, a corporate governance consulting firm, and a fellow at Rutgers University's Center for Corporate Law and Governance. Such rules are in place to protect investors' rights. To deter insider trading, CEOs, other senior executives and board members are generally restricted from trading in their own company's stock, except during designated trading windows, Chia said. Those windows usually open in the two weeks immediately after the company's quarterly earnings report is released. The trades must be cleared with a company's legal department and reported within two days to the SEC, Chia said. Overview of the 14 companies cited The COVID-19 disease can be traced back to Dec. 31, when the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. Eight days later, China identified it as a new type of coronavirus. The first coronavirus case in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21. We found that of the 14 companies listed in the post, only two had corporate CEOs who resigned their posts - and actually left their companies - after the coronavirus surfaced in China. Another two CEOs sold company stock after the outbreak. At the time of the sales, however, the outbreak was already publicly known, and the CEOs hadn't yet left their companies. We found no evidence the CEOs received advance information about the coronavirus or that they left in order to be freed from regulations that restricted their ability to sell stock. The 2 who left their companies Of the corporate CEOs alluded to in the Facebook post, two resigned between Dec. 31, 2019, and March 29, 2020, the date of the post - and left their companies: Harley-Davidson announced Feb. 28 that Matthew Levatich had stepped down as CEO and a director. The company's shares had fallen 46% since he took charge in May 2015. MGM Resorts announced Feb. 12 that Jim Murren had decided not to serve out his contract, which ran through the end of 2021, but that he would stay on until a successor was named. MGM's announcement, the earlier of the two, came two weeks after the Trump administration suspended entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. On Feb. 19 and 20, Murren sold more than $22 million of the company's common stock, at between $32.15 and $32.17 a share, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The sales were made public to the SEC. About a month later, MGM closed its Las Vegas casinos because of the coronavirus, and Murren acquired 6,000 shares of MGM restricted stock units. On the day Murren's purchase was disclosed, March 18, the stock price had dropped to $7.14. But Murren was still CEO during both sets of stock transactions. He stepped down as CEO on March 22, the same day it was announced he would lead a state coronavirus task force formed by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. 5 out as CEO, but still with company Five CEOs stepped down from their positions, but were staying with their companies as executive chairman, a top leadership post that typically involves some day-to-day duties in addition to a seat on the board. Companies often say they want the former CEO to stay for a limited period of time to ensure a smooth transition to the new CEO, Chia said. CEOs who resigned but stayed on as executive chairman were still under restrictions for trading in their company's stock. Walt Disney's Robert Iger stepped down Feb. 25 after a 15-year tenure as CEO, but remained with Disney as executive chairman, the company said in a statement. Lockheed Martin announced March 16 that Marillyn Hewson would be replaced effective June 15, but that she would remain as executive chairman. She sold $9.5 million in Lockheed stock on Jan. 29. IBM on Jan. 30 announced a new CEO to replace Virginia Rometty. But it said Rometty would continue as executive chairman and serve through the end of 2020, when she would retire after almost 40 years with the company. LinkedIn: announced Feb. 5 that Jeffrey Weiner 'decided to take on a new role as executive chairman.' He won't step down as CEO until June 1. Mastercard announced Feb. 25 that Ajay Banga would transition to the position of executive chairman on Jan. 1, 2021, and remain CEO until then. 3 left before the outbreak Three of the CEOs cited on the list left their posts or announced their departures before the coronavirus outbreak surfaced. eBay's Devin Wenig tweeted that his departure was because 'it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new Board.' That was on Sept. 25, more than three months before the first report out of Wuhan. T-Mobile announced Nov. 18, 2019, that John Legere would depart on April 30. Nissan announced Sept. 9 that Hiroto Saikawa had indicated he was willing to resign and the board asked him to resign, effective Sept. 16. His term was marked by controversy over the arrest of former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, turmoil with partner Renault SA and a sharp falloff in profits, the Wall Street Journal reported. Several others don't fit the Facebook claim In a few cases, the CEO departures were long-planned, or at a subsidiary level, not at the parent company. And one purported CEO resignation wasn't that at all. Nestle CEO Mark Schneider is still in place. The post might have been referring to Fernando Mercé. He resigned Feb. 21 as president and CEO of Nestlé Waters North America, a subsidiary, 'due to personal reasons,' the company told BevNET. Hulu CEO Randy Freer was stepping down, The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 31, as new owner Walt Disney Co. integrates the streaming service more closely into its direct-to-consumer business. Freer's departure had been expected since Disney took over control of Hulu last May, The Verge reported. Volkswagen said Luca de Meo, the head of the automaker's Spanish brand, SEAT, resigned Jan. 7. He's becoming the new CEO of Renault. But Herbert Diess, CEO of the parent company, has been in place for two years. Microsoft has had the same CEO, Satya Nadella, since 2014. The company announced March 13 that co-founder Bill Gates stepped down from the board to dedicate more time to his philanthropic activities, but would remain as a technology adviser to Nadella and others in the company. Minow said it's good that executives are required to disclose their personal sales of company stock so that their actions can be scrutinized. But she advocates for rules that would prohibit top executives from selling their company stock until three to five years after they've left the company. 'We want them to be thinking long term up until the day they leave,' she said.",,,,"Says CEOs got advance notice of COVID, then resigned to dump stock.",refuted,false,"<p>CEOs can resign for any number of reasons, including normal succession planning and mandatory retirement ages, or because of board pressure over subpar performance.

On July 1, Belle Delphine posted a photograph of herself to her four million Instagram followers, writing: 'I am now selling my bath water for all you thirsty gamer boys. Check out my new shop where I'm selling stuff for you!! www.belledelphinestore.com': BelleDelphineStore.com was a functioning website, and the listing for 'GamerGirl Bathwater' indicated that small containers of some form of liquid were indeed on sale for $30 each, although the item was listed as 'Out of stock' as of July 9. The description of the bathwater included a remarkable disclaimer: 'Bottled while I'm playing in the bath. This really is bath water. Disclaimer: This water is not for drinking and should only be used for sentimental purposes.' At least two YouTubers received delivery of the 'GamerGirl Bathwater,' both having posted videos about the product, although we can't confirm that the packages they received contained bathwater (as opposed to some other kind of water).

Our rating: Half True. Burns says he is 'one of America's leading consumer lawyers.' Our rating: False.","Rebecca Dallet argues she is the most experienced candidate running in the Feb. 20, 2018, primary for Wisconsin Supreme Court. The liberal-leaning Milwaukee County circuit judge faces Madison attorney Tim Burns, a declared Democrat, and conservative Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock. The two with the most votes will square off April 3 to replace conservative Justice Michael Gableman, who is not seeking re-election. Dallet, in answering questions from the Wisconsin Justice Initiative about her qualifications, said that as a judge she has 'presided over more than 10,000 cases.' Her response, published online Jan. 19, 2018, essentially repeats a claim she has made a number of times, including in news releases and in interviews. 'Presided over' suggests significant involvement in a case and 10,000 is a big number. Let's take a look. Dallet's caseload Dallet was elected judge in 2008. As one of 47 Milwaukee County judges, she currently serves in the civil division, which handles cases such as lawsuits, small claims and restraining orders. She previously was assigned homicide, felony drug, felony sexual assault and felony gun cases; general misdemeanor and domestic violence cases, and other matters. We contacted the Milwaukee County circuit clerk's office, which provided a spreadsheet of cases in which Dallet is listed as the 'responsible court official.' The spreadsheet shows 11,808 cases assigned to Dallet. The major categories break down this way: But there are some points worth noting. Amy Wochos, a senior administrator with the court clerk's office, told us the list probably both overcounts and undercounts Dallet's cases. For example, the list does not include cases where Dallet conducted some hearings, but then the case was transferred to another judge to conduct the remaining hearings. And the list includes cases in which another judge conducted all the hearings in a case, but then the case was technically transferred to Dallet before it was officially closed in the court system. An example of the latter: In the first case on Dallet's list, a West Allis man was charged in 2008 with drug possession. The court record shows he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The man's initial court appearance and some other matters were handled by Circuit Court commissioners; an indigency hearing and a status conference were held by one Circuit Court judge and the sentencing was handled by another judge. For all practical purposes, the case was complete, but it was transferred to Dallet prior to a formal judgment of conviction being entered into the record. It's worth noting that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through a plea bargain, not by a trial. But trials can lead to lengthy proceedings. An example: In December 2008, a Milwaukee man was charged with second offense possession of marijuana, a felony, and misdemeanor bail jumping. Court commissioners handled the initial steps, including a hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to put the man on trial. Starting in January 2009, Dallet handled the case the rest of the way, for a total of about six months. In-court proceedings included a motion hearing, a scheduling conference, a pretrial conference and several other hearings leading up to a two-day jury trial. The man was found guilty and was sentenced by Dallet on March 30, 2009. The case came before Dallet again three months later, when she had to rule on a request from the man regarding his sentencing. Before we wrap up, one more example: The first civil case on Dallet's list was a foreclosure filed in March 2010. It remained on the court docket for more than seven years, until November 2017, though it was before Dallet only briefly. The case was transferred to her in March 2016 and she later issued two orders in the case. In sum, some cases handled by a judge can involve numerous actions and proceedings over a period of months, while others require less activity. And it's important to note that in-court proceedings don't take into account any research or other preparation a judge has to do outside of court. Like criminal cases, Dallet may have spent relatively little time on some civil cases and much more time on others. Our rating Dallet says that as a judge, she has 'presided over more than 10,000 cases.' The best-available count shows Dallet has handled some 11,800 cases, including criminal and civil matters.

There is no evidence that vaccines cause babies to die from SIDS - the sudden, unexpected death of an apparently healthy baby younger than 1 year, usually during sleep. The cause of SIDS is unknown.

For reports in the database of the deaths of children up to age 17, 79.4% received more than one vaccine on the same day; and among infants, 86.2% received more than one vaccine on the same day. So, the study said the vast majority of infant deaths occurred among infants who received more than one vaccination on the same day. But receiving more than one vaccine on the same day is common for infants. And the study did not say that the infants died on the same day as the vaccination. Moreover, the study said: 'Because SIDS peaks at a time when children are receiving many recommended vaccinations, it would not be unexpected to observe a coincidental close temporal relationship between vaccination and SIDS.' The CDC says currently: 'Babies receive multiple vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This age range is also the peak age for SIDS. The timing of the 2-month and 4-month shots and SIDS has led some people to question whether they might be related. However, studies have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS.' We rated False a claim made in June that SIDS 'is absolutely a side effect of vaccination.' We cited the lack of any evidence that vaccines cause SIDS, and noted that studies actually show that receiving recommended immunizations can lower an infant's risk of SIDS.

Presented like a business card, it mislabeled the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as singular 'Disability' act, included the ADA information line's phone number, and claimed there would be steep fines for any violation. In an announcement on ADA.gov, while not explicitly referencing the above card, the Department of Justice (DOJ) declared such postings or flyers on the internet that used its seal as fraudulent. The San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, California, reiterated this: The Freedom to Breathe Agency (FTBA), according to its Facebook page, was previously known as the Anti-Mask Task Force, and described itself as a 'movement of proud American citizens who are dedicated to protecting their freedom and liberty.' They would not be able to enforce any action against offenders because they are not connected to a government agency. But the card's fake credentials implied that able-bodied bearers could exploit legitimate ADA regulations meant to protect people with disabilities. Snopes fact-checked a similar story in May 2020, when we learned that the ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask regulations must accommodate individuals who cannot wear masks due to their health or a disability. Coinciding with claims made in the card's text, in many parts of the U.S., people aren't required to disclose their physical condition if a business asks for proof of disability. But able-bodied people who seek to exploit such protections would not be supported by the ADA if, for example, they tried to sue a business for refusing them entry. In our previous investigation, we reached out to numerous ADA centers across the country. The New England ADA Center, for instance, told us: The ADA protects the privacy of people who have disabilities. People who lie about a medical condition and don't have one, do not have rights under the ADA. In sum, even though their arguments rely on existing protections for people with disabilities, such cards arguing that bearers can be exempted from wearing masks are totally fake.

Known as Senate Bill 5, the legislation is drawing raucous crowds to the normally serene Statehouse atrium. Republican Gov. John Kasich, backed by a Republican-controlled legislature, wants to end collective bargaining for state workers and abate the ability of city workers, including firefighters and police officers, to bargain for pay and benefits. Republican leaders say such reforms are needed to lower costs and ease the financial burden on the state and city budgets. Democratic leaders, flanked by a few Republcian office holders and lots of labor leaders, argue that teachers and firefighters and other union workers are not overpaid and that collective bargaining keeps both workers and employers in check at a minimal cost. The Ohio Democratic Party on Feb. 14 boiled down its argument in a Twitter message. Both the brevity and first word of the tweet caught Politifact Ohio's attention: 'FACT: the 'special assistant' in @johnkasich's office makes over three times more than an average #OH firefighter' Given the debate that rages on behind the tweet, we thought it was worth checking out. The tweet refers to Jai Chabria, a senior advisor, or special assistant, to Kasich, says ODP communications director Seth Bringman. Chabria, who worked with Kasich at the defunct Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, is part of governor's inner-circle, whose members are paid six-figure salaries, a point that received a good bit of attention earlier this year. Chabria's annual salary is $145,000 and is not subject to any collective bargaining deal. He serves at the pleasure of the governor. ODP's Bringman says the tweet also refers to the average annual salary of an Ohio firefighter of $41,160. He cities the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the tweet's source. The bureau indeed shows that the mean, or average, salary of an Ohio firefighter is $41,160. The figure does not include benefits and is based on the data compiled in May 2009, the latest available. It's important to note that the figure, however, is based on six surveys of 200,000 employers collected over a three-year period, not on an actual accounting of every Ohio firefighter's salary. Looking for something more current, Politifact Ohio compared the bureau's survey data to actual salary data collected by the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund, which manages the retirement plans for safety officers. Spokesman David Graham says the fund doesn't track the average salary of an Ohio firefighter but actual raw data is compiled in actuary reports. According to one such report in 2010 by Buck Consultants, there are 13,001 full-time fire personnel in Ohio whose collective annual salary totaled $860,966,828. Dividing the total salary by the number of personnel produces an average annual salary of $66,000. The actuary reports also reveal that firefighters with one-year of experience are paid an average salary of $45,000. Fire personnel with 40 years of experience can earn $80,000. The data can also be sliced numerous other ways to produce a range of salary figures. But the pension fund figures also include other ranking officers, like captains or chiefs, who earn more and would raise the average. The data also doesn't separate firefighters who are cross-trained as paramedics or in hazardous materials and typically earn more than others firefighters. 'It includes the fire chief from Cleveland to the firefighter from Piqua,' Graham said. He couldn't say exactly what ranks and specialties are in the latest figures but said captains and others all qualify under Ohio Revised Code as firefighters and therefore are members of the pension fund. So where does this leave the Ohio Democratic Party's tweet on the Truth-O-Meter? Chabria's salary of $145,000 is more than three times the salary figure of $41,160 that the party cited.

'Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay,' O'Scanlon wrote in the Dec. 16 piece published in The Star-Ledger. 'When and how will we know when we've achieved 'fairness'?' Millionaires are paying an 'effective tax rate' four times more than those earning $100,000? That's right, PolitiFact New Jersey found. According to the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective income tax rate of 6.88 percent, compared with 1.73 percent for people earning $100,000. O'Scanlon told us his point was that those earning $1 million already pay their fair share. An increase in income taxes could drive people out of the state or discourage them from moving to New Jersey, O'Scanlon said. 'It's wonderful politics,' O'Scanlon said. 'It's lousy policy.' First, let's explain what an 'effective tax rate' is. New Jersey currently imposes state income tax rates ranging from 1.4 percent on income of $20,000 or less to a top rate of 8.97 percent on income of $500,001 or greater. But those rates don't represent what individuals actually pay in total income taxes, because a person's income faces different rates as his income increases. Also, taxpayers can receive various exemptions and deductions. So, the 'effective tax rate' represents the percentage of one's gross income that actually goes toward income taxes. Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman, told us the department calculated effective tax rates for O'Scanlon, per the following income levels: $100,000: 1.73 percent $1 million: 6.88 percent $5 million: 8.5 percent $10 million: 8.72 percent Based on those numbers, someone earning $1 million is paying $68,800 in state income taxes, compared to $1,730 for taxpayers earning $100,000. For individuals with smaller incomes, the effective tax rate is even less. Taxpayers earning between $20,001 and $50,000 pay an effective tax rate of 0.7 percent, according to the state Treasury department. Pratt also noted how higher-income earners represent a small percentage of taxpayers, but provide a significant portion of the tax revenue. 'Notice that income over $500,000 represents an infinitesimal 0.2 percent of taxpayers, yet brings in 34.1 percent of tax revenue,' Pratt said in an email. 'Throw in the rest of the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and you get 37 percent of total tax collections.' Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us an effective tax rate is the 'appropriate measure to assess tax burden.' 'That's the share of income going to taxes. A person's effective tax rate equals her tax liability divided by her pretax income,' Williams said in an email. 'Thus a person making $100,000 and paying a total of $15,000 in tax(es) faces an effective tax rate of 15%.' Our ruling In an opinion piece in the Star-Ledger, O'Scanlon wrote: 'Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay.' Based on data from the state Treasury department, O'Scanlon is correct. Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate of 6.88 percent, which is about four times the 1.73 percent paid by individuals earning $100,000. We rate the statement True.

As described by TheFreeDictionary: The president can use [executive orders] to set policy while avoiding public debate and opposition. Presidents have used executive orders to direct a range of activities, including establishing migratory bird refuges; putting Japanese-Americans in internment camps during World War II; discharging civilian government employees who had been disloyal, following World War II; enlarging national forests; prohibiting racial discrimination in housing; pardoning Vietnam War draft evaders; giving federal workers the right to bargain collectively; keeping the federal workplace drug free; and sending U.S. troops to Bosnia. Historically, executive orders [are] related to routine administrative matters and to the internal operations of federal agencies, such as amending Civil Service Rules and overseeing the administration of public lands. More recently, presidents have used executive orders to carry out legislative policies and programs. As a result, the executive order has become a critical tool in presidential policy making. For example, President John F. Kennedy used an executive order to eliminate racial discrimination in federally funded housing, President Lyndon B. Johnson acted through an executive order to prohibit discrimination in government contractors' hiring practices, and President Richard M. Nixon used an executive order to set a ninety-day freeze on all prices, rents, wages, and salaries in reaction to rising inflation and unemployment. The item reproduced above purports that President Obama issued a whopping 923 executive orders in his first term (compared to about thirty each for previous presidents) and offers supposedly alarming provisions of some of those orders. However, the entirety of this item is erroneous. First of all, the number of executive orders issued by President Obama is grossly exaggerated here. Through his first term (i.e., the first four years of his presidency), Barack Obama issued 147 executive orders, not 923. (Barack Obama signed a total of 275 executive orders during his two terms, averaging 35 a year; the lowest number signed since Grover Cleveland.) Moreover, compared to President Obama's predecessors in the White House, this is not an unusually large number of orders for a modern president: President George W. Bush issued 291 executive orders during his eight years in office, while President Bill Clinton issued 364 such orders over the same span of time. The listing of numbers of executive orders issued during the terms of modern presidents included in one of the examples above also bears no resemblance to reality. This chart compares the claimed number of orders issued by each president on the list with the actual number issued, as documented by The American Presidency Project: Name Number claimed: Actual number: Theodore Roosevelt 3 1,081 Franklin Roosevelt 11 3,522 Harry Truman 5 907 Dwight Eisenhower 2 484 John Kennedy 4 214 Lyndon Johnson 4 325 Richard Nixon 1 346 Gerald Ford 3 169 Jimmy Carter 3 320 Ronald Reagan 5 381 George H.W.

Bush 62 291 Barack Obama 923 275 The attribution to President Obama of fourteen executive orders (numbered between 10990 to 11921) in the example text reproduced above is way off base as well: not a single one of those orders was issued by President Obama.

It's possible to argue over whether the initial amount should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich didn't pull that figure out of thin air, and it certainly was high by historical standards. He also used the term 'hole,' which is more appropriate than 'deficit' would have been. Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it's worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that 'I' did it, since the state's fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","During the Republican presidential debate on his home turf of Cleveland, Ohio Gov. John Kasich touted his economic record in the state. Repeating a claim he has often made -- including on his campaign website -- Kasich said, 'I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole ... to a $2 billion surplus.' We decided to take a closer look. An $8 billion hole? There's an argument for $8 billion, but there's also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011. The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich's budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with 'conceptually' in a 2011 interview with the newspaper, though he took issue with some of the methodological details. Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this in the debate as a 'hole' rather than a deficit, since Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. A $2 billion surplus? This figure is clearer. The state's Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state's 'rainy day fund' had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. Does Kasich deserve credit? It's not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state's improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state's fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. But it's important to remember that he took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio's.

John Kitzhaber called on lawmakers to make a range of difficult decisions in order to put more money into schools. The actions include reducing the costs of health care and corrections. State forecasters estimate the prison population will grow, in part due to tougher sentencing measures and in part due to overall population growth, at an extra cost of $600 million over the next 10 years. The governor said most of the beds will be occupied by nonviolent offenders. Kitzhaber acknowledged that politicians don't like to appear 'soft on crime.' But he asked them to keep two numbers in mind as they go forward. 'It costs $10,000 a year to keep a child in school; it costs $30,000 a year to keep someone in prison,' he said. 'If we are unwilling to act on this issue, in this upcoming legislative session, we will by default be choosing prisons over schools.' Obviously, it's more expensive to house and feed an inmate than to teach a child. One is a round-the-clock operation; the other isn't. But are the governor's numbers right? Is there a 3-to-1 ratio? We figured this would be a simple check. Right away, through the magic of the Internet, we found a news report from 2012 in The Oregonian that stated that 'the state spends an average of $30,000 a year to house, feed and care for an inmate.' Of course, PolitiFact Oregon is all about primary sources, so we went to the Department of Corrections, where we found a quick facts page.It states that the daily cost of housing an inmate in the 2011-13 budget period is $84.81 -- which comes out to nearly $31,000 a year. The governor's Commission on Public Safety reports a slightly lower number still in the ballpark -- $82.48 a day or $30,105 a year. The cost is for 'security, health care, food, recidivism reduction programs like mental health and drug treatment, and other operational costs, but excludes community corrections grants, debt service, capital construction, and new prison start‐up costs.' (The $82.48 figure is the same as in a Legislative Fiscal Office analysis of the Corrections budget, dated September 2011. What we're trying to say is that both per day breakdowns come from the same source, the state.) OK, one number down, another to go. The Oregon Department of Education also has nifty numbers, including spending per pupil. In 2010-11, operational expenses were nearly $9,400 per student, statewide. (Capital spending per child was $777, but we're going to stick with the $9,400 figure because the corrections cost does not include capital spending.) The costs range, of course, from $27,947 apiece for 35 students in the Burnt River School District in Baker County to $5,566 in the Scio School District in Linn County. Portland Schools, the largest in the state, spends about $11,830 per student. We should note here that prosecutors are not enthusiastic about Kitzhaber's plans to 'reform' public safety, and say that the Oregon's corrections system is fine as is. John Foote, Clackamas County's district attorney, served on the governor's public safety commission and submitted a minority report supported by district attorneys, the association of chiefs of police and the state sheriffs' association. We contacted Foote. He concurs on the math, but he says Oregon is considered a high cost state, in that we don't incarcerate a lot of people but the cost is high when we do. The obvious fix, he says, is to lower the daily cost of incarceration. Are we very high on daily costs? That's a perfectly fine question for another PolitiFact. In this PolitiFact, we're checking Kitzhaber's math.

This contention fits quite closely with campaign data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, it's worth noting that this data refers to cumulative donations as far back as the 1980s, rather than just donations to their current presidential bids. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.","As Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gains ground on Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the two candidates' supporters have been sparring, including over campaign donations. Recently, a reader sent us a social media meme that paints Clinton's list of donors as dominated by corporate interests, whereas Sanders' top 10 donors come largely from labor unions -- a dichotomy that, to Democratic primary voters, puts Sanders in a more favorable light. 'Hillary: Top ten donor list. Representing banks, corporations and media,' the meme reads, providing a top-10 list with dollar amounts. 'Bernie: Top ten donor list. Representing people.' The meme is topped by each candidate's presidential campaign logo. (See the meme below.) We can't tell who produced this meme, but we thought it was worth a closer look. We'll start by noting that reasonable people can disagree about whether labor unions represent 'people,' as the meme says, as opposed to just unionized workers, who are a relatively small subset of the entire population. We'll also note that while this meme may appeal to union supporters and critics of Wall Street and big corporations, it also could be used as evidence that Sanders is just as reliant on one type of donor -- labor unions -- as Clinton is on big corporations. We found that the data cited in the meme refers to cumulative donations over the course of each candidate's political career as calculated by the Center for Responsive Politics, not just fundraising from the current presidential cycle. (Clinton and Sanders have announced their fundraising hauls for the second quarter of 2015, but have not yet released the full data that is due at the Federal Election Commission by July 15; a more complete analysis of the data will be compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics after that.) For Clinton, we found a high degree of similarity with the meme when we checked the database on July 6. Clinton's top 10 cumulative donors between between 1999 and 2016 were, in descending order, Citigroup ($782,327), Goldman Sachs ($711,490), DLA Piper ($628,030), JPMorgan Chase ($620,919), EMILY's List ($605,174) Morgan Stanley ($543,065), Time Warner ($411,296), Skadden Arps ($406,640), Lehman Brothers ($362,853) and Cablevision Systems ($336,288). That list is quite close to what the meme says. It includes five financial-services companies, two law firms that do a lot of corporate work, two media conglomerates and one group, EMILY's list, that supports abortion-rights Democratic candidates. It's worth noting that Clinton was a senator from New York, meaning that some of the donors on her list were not simply Wall Street and corporate behemoths, but also constituents, based in New York. The database results for Sanders are also quite close to what's in the meme. The data for Sanders goes back to 1989. His top 10 are, in descending order, Machinists/Aerospace Workers union ($105,000), Teamsters union ($93,700), National Education Association ($84,350), United Auto Workers ($79,650), United Food & Commercial Workers union ($72,500), Communications Workers of America ($68,000), Laborers Union ($64,000), Carpenters & Joiners Union ($62,000), National Association of Letter Carriers ($61,000), and the American Association for Justice ($60,500). In the meme, the letter carriers' union makes the list, but the Center for Responsive Politics has the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees cracking the top 10 instead. Either way, nine of the 10 are unions, and the tenth is the national association representing plaintiffs' attorneys. During his career, Sanders has received strong support from progressive Democrats, so this pattern of financial backing is not surprising. So the meme is pretty accurate for both candidates. However, we see a few things worth pointing out. As we noted, this data refers to their entire political careers back to the 1990s. Once the full presidential data is released, those figures may show different patterns. 'That is not made clear' in the meme, said Anthony J. Corrado, a campaign-finance expert at Colby College. 'Most people would assume that this is money raised so far in the 2016 presidential campaign.' Also, the 'donors' listed are not the ones who gave the money, since that would be against the law. Rather, it was their PACs, employees and those employees' families. In fact, due to how the forms are filled out, the data is less likely to capture individual donations from union members than from employers of companies. Most individual donations are listed by employer, and if, say, a union carpenter lists his affiliation as his company, the fact that he's a union member wouldn't be recorded. Finally, lists such as this ignore that both candidates are collecting many small donations, too. According to the Clinton campaign, she raised roughly $50 million in contributions under $200 during her '08 campaign. Data for the 2016 cycle is not available yet. All told, it's possible to look at the top donors on the two lists and say both candidates are captive to a particular set of interest groups, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. However, he added, 'labor is a Democratic constituency whose beliefs generally line up with Democratic policies, and we're talking about a Democratic primary here. So all things being equal, Sanders' donor list probably looks better, politically, than Clinton's.' Kondik added that, as the meme indicates, Clinton has a much larger reservoir of money than Sanders has. 'The value of having a large financial advantage over your competitors in a primary setting seems to be worth occasional questions about how the financial advantage was built,' he said.",,,,"Says Hillary Clinton's top 10 donors are mainly 'banks, corporations and media,' while Bernie Sanders' top 10 donors are labor unions.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

As The New York Times observed of Pompeo in March 2019, 'no secretary of state in recent decades has been as open and fervent as Mr. Pompeo about discussing Christianity and foreign policy in the same breath. That has increasingly raised questions about the extent to which evangelical beliefs are influencing American diplomacy.' That questioning of Pompeo's mixture of religiosity and policy was reflected in a meme circulated in January 2020, amidst escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran over the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad: The quote reproduced in this meme - about continuing to fight battles and struggle until the moment of the Rapture - was taken from a talk Pompeo delivered at a 'God and Country Rally' held at Summit Church in Wichita, Kansas, on June 28, 2015. The event was just a few days after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision holding that same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry. The words reproduced above were excerpted from a portion of Pompeo's speech, as captured here: However, that short clip doesn't provide the full context of Pompeo's remark, which was not specifically about military or political battles.

This was a man who[m] she had not met before, but he took time from his role to pray for her and to thank her and to make clear that his Christian understanding of our nation was not just in her heart but his, and that he would work every day to make sure that the Lord's work govern our actions each and every day. It was a remarkable moment. We are blessed to live in Kansas where there are so many people that understand that. We will continue to fight these battles. It is a never-ending struggle.

Gentle Giants says it rescues the large horses from slaughter, abuse, and neglect, noting that horse slaughter is an industry most of the public is unaware of, and that buyers for the slaughterhouses get the horses at public auctions. Sadly, draft horses are at high risk because their size makes them profitable for that industry, per the rescue. According to Lauren Nation, development director for Gentle Giants, it's unlikely that Phantom will take the Guinness World Record designation of 'world's tallest horse,' a title previously previously held by Big Jake, a Belgian horse residing in Wisconsin. Big Jake died in June 2021 at the age of 20. Nation said that although Phantom is very big, there are likely bigger horses, considering that his breed, Shire horses, are known to get even taller than he is. 'While he is large, he is likely nowhere near being the world's tallest horse,' Nation told Snopes in an email. 'His friend Teton, a large Percheron, is just 3 inches shorter than him.

But the original picture was captured by National Geographic Your Shot contributor Clinton Berry. Titled 'When Penguins Attack,' the photograph was shot with a GoPro on Antarctica's sea ice, about six miles from the continent's permanent research outpost, Casey Station. 'I studied the movements of the penguins for weeks,' Berry wrote in National Geographic. 'They walked in the same area almost every day. We would get maybe a dozen or less going by. The day this was taken there were over 60 penguins. It was a bit of luck involved too.' There are 18 species of penguins, five of which live in Antarctica and another four that live on sub-Antarctic islands. The bird in the photograph is known as an Adélie penguin, which goes by the scientific name Pygoscelis adeliae. The region has more than 80,000 breeding pairs, all of which are distinguished by the white ring that surrounds their eyes. Penguins are insulated by heavy fat reserves, which make them well-suited for the frigid temperatures of the southernmost continent. And though they can't fly, the Oreo-colored birds make up for this inability with their excellent swimming talents. Adélie can dive to depths of more than 500 feet, though they usually feed on fish, amphipods, and krill in the upper 200 feet of the water column. It is this unique form of predation that makes their bizarre mouths so useful. Penguins don't have teeth, but they do have teeth-like spikes known as papillae on the tongue and palate that are made of keratin, the same protein found in the nails and hair of humans. Though they lack tastebuds, these keratinized bristles help penguins swallow their prey. 'First off, you may notice that those spiky papillae all point toward the back of the penguin's mouth. Those work a bit like a fish hook,' wrote the nonprofit conservation organization, Penguins International. 'The penguin can grab onto a slippery fish and that food will now only move in one direction - down the penguin's throat!' All tongues have papillae - even ours. Known as 'protruding papillae,' those found on penguins are just more obvious and typical of food collectors. (If you thought the penguin's tongue was creepy, check out those found in this leatherback turtle.) On the Adélie penguins' tongue, these papillae look sharp on the top and curve backward toward the back of the mouth, which helps the birds to efficiently slurp down fish at impressive depths.

Higgins' post described how the country was dealing with the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and claimed that 'the news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here.' Many Snopes readers inquired about Higgins' post, which racked up more than a half-million shares within two days, so we have reproduced it in full at the end of this article, and we'll address a few of the claims made in the post. But first let's verify that Higgins is the author of this post and that she truly lives in Italy. Attribution on the internet can be a difficult thing. Facebook posts like this are often copied, pasted, and spread across social media where they get attributed to a variety of sources. An unattributed version of this post, for instance, was viewed more than 100,000 times after it was posted to Imgur. Higgins does appear to be the true author of this post, however. NBC News contacted her after the post went viral and reported that she is an American currently living in Italy. NBC News writes: For nearly two weeks, Cristina Higgins, an American who lives in Italy, has traveled no farther from her apartment building than the driveway. Her days begin at the breakfast table with her husband and three children before the kids log online to do their schoolwork from home. The family spends their evenings playing Monopoly in their apartment. [...] 'We have friends who are getting sick. It's very stressful,' Higgins told NBC News over the phone from her home in Bergamo, where she, like everyone else, is under government-ordered home isolation, even though she and her family are not sick. 'I am nauseous all day long, because every time I look at the news or talk to somebody else, something terrible has happened. And I don't know what's going to happen next.' [...] Higgins said she rarely posts to Facebook but felt it was important to convey to those outside of Italy who can't comprehend how bad the situation is that they need to do whatever they can to not pass on the disease. Higgins appears to be the true author of this post. Furthermore, the claims she made in the post, generally speaking, are accurate. Let's examine a few of her assertions. Is COVID-19 the Same as the Flu? While COVID-19 has been compared to the flu and has similar symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that COVID-19 was at least '10 times as lethal' as the seasonal flu. Here's a clip of Fauci's testimony: We transcribed the relevant portion below: For the practical understanding of the American people, the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%. The stated mortality overall of this [coronavirus], when you look at all the data including China, is about 3% [...]. If you count all the cases of minimal symptomatic or asymptomatic infection, that probably brings the mortality rate down to 1%. Which means that it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. Is Italy Under Lockdown? In general, yes. Italy has restricted public gatherings and travel for all 60 million of its residents. Nonessential businesses such as restaurants and bars have been closed, and the country is encouraging social distancing. Food stores and pharmacies are about the only businesses that will be allowed to stay open until restrictions are lifted. CNN reported: Italy has imposed sweeping nationwide restrictions on travel and public life, a desperate attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak that looks set to plunge the world's eighth largest economy into a steep recession. The measures announced late Monday include travel restrictions on 60 million residents, a ban on public events, the closure of schools, movie theaters, museums and gyms, and limits on opening hours for restaurants, bars and shops. The government took action as the number of deaths caused by coronavirus reached 463 and infections topped 9,000, more than double the number reported in China as a share of the population. The restrictions are in place until at least April 3. Are Intensive Care Units in Italy Operating at Capacity? One major concern about a viral outbreak is that there won't be enough beds and supplies to treat sick people. Although Italy may have adequate space to treat people during a normal year, hospitals can become overwhelmed when there is a surge of patients. That is currently the case in Italy. Vox reports: The coronavirus has overwhelmed the country's health system, particularly in the north. More than 80 percent of the hospital beds in Lombardy, the hardest-hit province, are being occupied by coronavirus patients, according to Bloomberg. Intensive care units are overloaded while elective surgeries have been canceled in the process to free up beds. Stories abound on social media about doctors struggling to meet their patients' needs, even rationing care. Can Young People Get the Coronavirus? Although older generations are certainly at higher risk of dying from this disease, young people are not immune to COVID-19. The CDC writes that 'infections in children have been reported, including in very young children.' While many younger people may have a strong enough immune system to survive the disease, they can catch it, carry it, and spread it to more people. The Verge writes: Most people who are young or healthy and who contract the virus don't get severely ill. But if you have the virus, even if you don't get that sick, you might come into contact with people who are more at risk - and pass the virus to them. That's why it's so important to stay home if you're not feeling well. Minimizing the number of people each sick person infects is low-tech, but it's the best way to slow the spread of a disease like COVID-19. It's the goal of policies like school closures and event cancellations and why people who might have been exposed to the illness are asked to isolate themselves. The Facebook Post For reference, here is the full text of Higgins's Facebook post: I am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country's reality. The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today. If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy. I can hear you now. 'It's just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions' There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it's knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU - and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms. When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was 'there is no more time.' Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse. Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity - more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left? On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse. There are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there? And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients - 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment. You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities - there is a two week incubation period - and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time. And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone's imagination a week ago. Soon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now. Please share.","Did Cristina Higgins Pen This Facebook Post About Coronavirus in Italy?

The video was accompanied by a message suggesting that the United States could easily afford to pay for the Green New Deal proposed in Congress or Medicare for all since the Navy was wasting so much money dumping trucks into the water: The text overlaid on the video reads: 'Trucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don't ever let anyone tell you we can't afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.' Several things are wrong with this assertion: This incident didn't 'just' happen. The video is from 2015. The object being launched is not a commercially available truck. This is actually a weighted sled (referred to by the Navy as a dead load). These sleds can be retrieved from the bottom of the river. Economic estimates for the proposed Green New Deal or Medicare for All vary, but they can't be compared to the cost of a few wasted pickup trucks. This viral clip originated with a video uploaded to the U.S. Navy's YouTube page in 16 June 2015 and shows a test of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), a catapult system designed to launch aircraft. At the time, the Navy was using dead loads to mimic the weight of an aircraft: Here's a better look at the 'truck' in the video: The viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these 'trucks' were lost and left to decay in the water. But that's not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests. A contemporary report from Engadget noted that this specific sled (which was not equipped with any electronics, an engine, or any other especially expensive materials) was recovered from the James River: The Navy has been testing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System or EMALS for months aboard the Gerald R. Ford carrier, but this is the first time a 'dead-load' (or a weighted steel sled that weighs up to 80,000 pounds) is involved. Its advantages over traditional catapults that use steam instead of electromagnetic energy include smoother acceleration and its ability to place less stress on the aircraft - plus, it was designed to work even with more advanced carriers that the military will surely use in the future. It will take a long time before any plane goes near the system, though: the Navy has already retrieved the sled above from the depths of the James River to conduct more dead-load launches. In July 2017, the first fixed-wing airplane was launched using EMALS: While one could certainly argue that the U.S. government wastes money on certain projects that would be better spent on more worthwhile endeavors, this viral Facebook video isn't the best example to support this argument.

China is actually the leader in the overall capacity for generating wind power. But the United States has overtaken China in terms of the actual amount of electricity wind power it generates. Both countries plan to continue to expand wind capacity -- China more than the United States -- but they also both face challenges to expanding capacity and generation. We rate the claim Mostly True.,"President Barack Obama devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to talking up America's energy trends, including being a leader in our own energy production. 'We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet,' he said. 'And today, America is No. 1 in oil and gas. America is No. 1 in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.' We've covered oil and gas and solar power before, but the wind energy claim was new to us. Is the United States the global leader in producing that, as well, or is Obama just being a blowhard? Let's get on the grid and find out. Clearing the air Obama has made renewable power sources a focus of his administration, and has effectively doubled the use of many 'clean energy' methods, a large portion of which has been from wind. The U.S. Energy Department says that the nation's capacity for generating energy from wind, in which wind moves a turbine to generate electricity to be used on the power grid, has increased from 25,410 megawatts in 2008 to 62,300 megawatts as of September 2014. This capacity growth was fueled in part to a federal production tax credit that expired at the end of 2014. There are still projects being built using the tax credit, so capacity is expected to keep growing. Many energy reports, however, generally say the United States trails China in its total wind energy capacity. The Global Wind Energy Council said in 2013 that China has the capacity to generate 91,412 megawatts. China also has outpaced the United States for wind-driven power installations. But that's where we run into a headwind on the stats, because there's a difference between capacity (what can be produced) and generation (what actually is produced). A Jan. 15, 2015, report by the American Wind Energy Association said the electrical energy actually being produced was currently greater in the United States than it was in China, and has been since 2008. The report said in 2013 the United States generated 167 billion kilowatt hours (a measure utility companies use to bill companies; a megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts), while China generated 138 billion kilowatt hours. Simon Mahan, renewable energy manager for the pro-renewable Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said there a many factors in determining the two different measurements, leading to discrepancies depending on how they're recorded. A wind farm in America may be more efficient than one in China because the wind is better, for example, making more power even if the one in China has more turbines. The focus on installations is due in part to the fixed capital costs of building a wind farm, and full-year generation data isn't available if, say, an installation opens in April, Mahan said. He compared capacity and generation to how a hybrid car's gasoline tank is smaller than a truck's, but both can go about the same distance because the hybrid is more efficient. Whether this difference lasts is up in the air. China has plans to build 150 gigawatts (that's 150,000 megawatts) of capacity by 2017. in the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. had an additional 13,600 megawatts of capacity under construction, which would bump the States up to around 75,000 megawatts of capacity next year, with potential projects in the future. Determining if either country maxes out that capacity depends on factors that can only be predicted and not confirmed, Mahan said, although China has issues with how much its power grid can safely hold at one time. The International Energy Agency has predicted the demand for wind power in China is slowing, while the United States faces 'policy uncertainty' that may affect wind power's future here.",,,,'America is No. 1 in wind power.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Polling data shows that roughly 65 percent of the public opposed the war by the second half of 2006, but while that qualifies as strong opposition, the definition of 'overwhelming' within the polling profession is more uncertain. On balance, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly True. UPDATE, June 20, 2014, 11:45 am: This article has been updated to include a response from Clinton's staff received after the story was published.","In her recently published memoir Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton acknowledges that 'she got it wrong' when she voted to authorize the Iraq War in 2003. As Iraq once again becomes a big news story, as Islamic militants take over large portions of the country's north and threaten the capital in Baghdad, we thought it would be worth checking one of Clinton's claims about the American public's perceptions of the Iraq War. In the seventh chapter of her memoir, Clinton writes that, 'by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war.' Is that correct? We looked at polling data about the war between 2003 and 2006, archived at PollingReport.com. (Here are the ones that fit the criteria for this fact-check.) Initially, Americans felt favorably about the war. While the wording changes somewhat from poll to poll, the level of support for the war was usually at or above two-thirds in mid- March 2003, right before the war began. That month, support hit 70 percent in a Newsweek poll, 64 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and 71 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. In the first few weeks after the attack was launched, support levels went as high as 77 percent in CBS News and Los Angeles Times polls, 78 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll and 81 percent in a Fox News poll. However, as the war continued, support began to soften. Eventually, support turned negative in some polls. By mid-May 2004 -- a little over a year after the start of the war -- Time and CNN asked, 'Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling the situation in Iraq?' and found 44 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval. The numbers were similar when the pollsters asked, 'In general, do you approve or disapprove of current military policy in Iraq?' Even the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll -- which as late as June 2004 found support at 60 percent -- found by February 2005 that a plurality of respondents, 49 percent, said going to war was the 'wrong thing' to have done, compared to 46 percent who said it was the 'right thing.' Disapproval of Bush's handling of the war reached 58 percent in August 2005 in an Associated Press/Ipsos poll, and it remained roughly the same in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in February 2006 and a CNN poll in May 2006. Finally, in the second half of 2006, opposition the war began to hit 2-to-1 margins over support for the war. In July 2006, when CBS and the New York Times asked, 'Do you think the result of the war with Iraq was worth the loss of American life and other costs of attacking Iraq, or not?' 63 percent said it was not worth it, compared to just 30 percent who said it was worth it. Then, in November 2006, Time asked about approval of Bush's handling of Iraq and found 65 percent disapproval and only 31 percent approval. Disapproval continued to rise slightly into 2007. AP found 68 percent disapproval of Bush's handling of Iraq in January 2007, and CNN/Opinion Research Corporation found 69 percent. So the polling generally tracks with time timeline Clinton offered. The only question is whether disapproval rates in the low-to-mid 60 percent range qualifies as 'overwhelming.' We were a little skeptical, so we asked some polling experts. 'That is an awfully subjective call,' said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll and co-founder of Pollster.com. 'I'd be surprised if there were any consensus where that line falls.' Mark Blumenthal, the senior polling editor of the Huffington Post and the founding editor of Pollster.com, said the use of 'overwhelming' strikes him as subjective, and depends on the context. 'What seems like an 'overwhelming' victory margin in a competitive electoral contest might not seem quite as 'overwhelming' in the context of attitudes about a particular policy issue,' he said. 'I'd guess I'd be OK with 2-to-1 for the former, but 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 for the latter.' Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Clinton, emailed us to say, 'In public opinion, if you're talking about 50-percent-plus opposition on an issue, I think most people would call that 'overwhelming.'' Vietor added that 'the 2006 elections, which went massively in the Democrats' favor, were viewed as a response to the war.'",,,,"'By 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

(It also holds a Guinness record for crowd noise, PolitiFact Missouri found.) So that part of the claim is accurate. Did 76,416 people cross the border illegally in February? Close to it. The Facebook post doesn't specify that it's talking about the southwest border, but it likely is referring to southwest border migration data published monthly by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In February, Border Patrol agents made 66,450 apprehensions at the southwest border. Apprehension data is commonly used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. The number refers to apprehensions between ports of entry. Customs and Border Protection also releases monthly tallies on the number of people who wanted to come into the United States legally but were turned away by border officers. Lacking proper travel documents is one of the reasons why someone might be denied entry. This segment is classified as 'inadmissibles.' In February, 9,653 people were deemed inadmissible after presenting themselves at ports of entries along the southwest border. Adding the number of people apprehended for illegal entry and the number of people who wanted to come in legally but were denied entry results in 76,103 people. (It's unclear if there's overlap in the numbers; for instance, if someone denied legal entry later tried to come in illegally.) The post suggests that it's mainly Mexicans who crossed the border illegally by featuring the Mexican flag in the middle of the stadium. Most immigrants now apprehended at the border are from Central America, not Mexico. One final note on the post's use of 'illegal immigrants:' Many of the people crossing the border are seeking asylum protection. To apply for asylum, migrants need to be present in the United States. Federal and international laws allow immigrants to apply for asylum whether they arrived here legally or illegally.

The tweet racked up thousands of likes and retweets and was shared by a number of news reporters. Eric Trump and other allies of President Donald Trump also picked it up. And it made the jump to Instagram when D'Souza shared it to his more than 900,000 followers. But Harris hasn't shunned the media, as D'Souza's Instagram post suggests. The California senator sat down for her first interview as a vice presidential candidate with the 19th News on Aug. 14, three days after Biden announced her as his running mate. Since then, Harris has done interviews with national organizations such as People, ABC News, NBC, Univision, BET and CNN. She also interviewed with the Grio, a site targeting African American readers, and she appeared on Showtime's late-night talk show, 'Desus and Mero.' On Sept. 21, two days before D'Souza's post, Harris spoke with Urban Radio Networks reporter and CNN political analyst April Ryan and joined radio host Russ Parr for his show. She is slated to appear Sept. 28 on MSNBC's 'The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.' Harris has also interviewed with a number of local news outlets. The outlets PolitiFact identified include: three TV stations and two radio stations serving south Florida; a TV station in Charlotte, N.C.; two TV stations in Milwaukee; a TV station in the San Francisco Bay Area; two TV stations in Phoenix; a TV station in Las Vegas; two TV stations in Philadelphia; a TV station in Detroit; and a TV station serving the Flint and Tri-Cities region of Michigan. When a reporter asked Biden why they hadn't 'seen her out very much' during a Sept. 4 press conference, Biden said Harris has been busy campaigning on his behalf. 'She's been on the road,' Biden said. 'She's out herself. The role is that, just like when Barack and I campaigned, we try to cover as much territory as we could, and both of us out campaigning.' Shivaram, the NBC News reporter, clarified her original point in a second tweet, which was posted in response to a question and received significantly fewer shares. She said Harris has, in fact, done interviews with both national networks and local outlets in states she's visited. What Harris hasn't had, Shivaram wrote, is an informal briefing where reporters covering her campaign stops can ask questions, aside from a 'few shouted questions.' 'Just to be clear, she's taken questions,' Shivaram tweeted in response to another reporter's retweet.

The Haitians who are arriving in Texas did not take a direct route from Haiti. They are people who left their country following the 2010 earthquake and went to South America to find jobs in Brazil and Chile. When opportunities dried up in those countries and conditions worsened, they began traveling north through Latin America toward Mexico. We rate this statement Mostly False.","Thousands of Haitian migrants fleeing poverty have arrived in the border town of Del Rio, Texas, as they try to cross illegally into the United States. The images and news reports of migrants gathered under a border bridge are the latest immigration challenge facing the Biden administration. The reports have also prompted some social media users to raise questions about how Haitians ended up crossing into Texas, rather than Florida, which is much closer to Haiti. 'Am I the only one that wonders how 14,000 Haitians traveled 2,000 miles to end up under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas?' stated one Facebook post showing a straight red line from Haiti, across the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to Texas. 'I doubt that they walked.' This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The short answer is that the Haitians did not come directly from Haiti to Texas. These migrants were traveling from South America, where they had lived in recent years. 'That's why they have ended up in Texas, not Florida. They are coming from South American countries, through Central America and Mexico, and ultimately to the U.S.-Mexico border,' said Jessica Bolter, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. 'They walk this route, as well as take buses and sometimes other forms of land transportation.' The 2010 earthquake in Haiti fueled migration Haiti has endured a series of tumultuous events in just the past few months, including a presidential assassination, tropical storms and an earthquake. But the current migrations seen in Texas trace back to 2010, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck the nation and destroyed large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Estimates vary, but the earthquake is reported to have killed more than 200,000 people and displaced more than 1.3 million. Many Haitians then traveled to South American countries, particularly Chile and Brazil, in search of jobs and a better life. The Brazilian government made humanitarian visas available to Haitians, and there was significant demand for construction workers leading up to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Once those jobs started to dry up, many Haitians moved on to Chile, Bolter said. The Associated Press reported that about 150,000 Haitians went to Chile from 2014 to 2018 and found work as street vendors, janitors and construction workers. However, since 2018, the Chilean government has made it more difficult for Haitians to get work visas. 'The cost of living in Chile is high, so it can be particularly difficult to get by with a poorly paying job,' Bolter said. 'Many Haitians experience racial discrimination in jobs and housing in Chile as well. Haitians who stayed in Brazil have continued to struggle economically, and have also faced racial discrimination, as well as crime and insecurity.' The COVID-19 pandemic made conditions worse for Haitian migrants. When President Joe Biden took office, Bolter said, many migrants believed that it would be easier to get into the U.S. than under Trump, and were emboldened to travel north. 'A lot of them came to Mexico with the hope of being able to live in Mexico,' Jacqueline Charles, the Miami Herald's Caribbean correspondent, told NPR's 'All Things Considered.' 'But they've had a very difficult time getting work permits, finding jobs, even finding a place to live. And so this is a community that, you know, operates through word of mouth. So people started saying, hey, Ciudad Acuña is open. This port is open.' Ciudad Acuña is the Mexican city across the Rio Grande from Del Rio, Texas. But it wasn't true that the port of entry was open to Haitians. Biden renewed Temporary Protected Status for Haitians in the U.S. earlier this year. That status - which the Trump administration had revoked for Haitians in 2017 - allows migrants to stay in the U.S. when conditions in their home country prevent them from returning safely. But the Biden policy applies only to Haitians who were living in the U.S. as of July 29, not to those crossing the border now. Biden administration continues Trump-era use of Title 42 expulsions Illegal border crossings by Haitian migrants are at a historic high, Bolter said. From October 2020 through August 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered Haitian migrants crossing the border illegally almost 28,000 times along the southwest border; 24,000 of those encounters took place in Texas. While the federal government has not yet released data for September, news reports cited as many as 15,000 migrants waiting in Del Rio. The Department of Homeland Security told PolitiFact that from Sept. 19 to 21, officials sent 1,083 Haitians from Del Rio to Port-au-Prince. Most are being expelled under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Title 42 authority - a Trump policy designed to curb COVID-19 spread - the agency said Sept. 18 'The Biden administration has reiterated that our borders are not open, and people should not make the dangerous journey,' DHS said. 'Individuals and families are subject to border restrictions, including expulsion.' Biden has faced criticism from lawmakers in both parties for his administration's actions on Haitians crossing the border illegally. Republicans say Biden has failed to secure the border while some Democrats have criticized the administration for continuing to use Title 42 to expel Haitians and the tactics used by some Border Patrol agents. Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas said he directed an immediate investigation of the actions by Border Patrol agents on horseback who were captured in photographs and on video blocking migrants from crossing the river.",,,,Haitian migrants took an implausible route to Texas-Mexico border area.,refuted,barely-true,<p>The Biden administration is using a public health measure called Title 42 to expel many of the migrants.</p>,politifact

The claim draws from the low-end of a range of estimates the CDC published in May saying the fatality rate for those showing symptoms was between 0.2% and 1%, with a 'best estimate' of 0.4%. The estimated overall mortality rate of those with and without symptoms would be 0.26%. Health experts, however, said it's difficult to pin down a precise mortality rate early in a pandemic and that the federal agency hasn't yet 'confirmed' any rate but instead offered best guesses. Over time, it is possible that estimates will show a lower than initially expected mortality rate, especially as more testing is conducted in the United States. Currently, however, the true number of deaths and infections are hard to determine, as some deaths caused by the virus aren't counted and many people with mild cases of the coronavirus are never tested. Several experts said they project the mortality rate is on the higher-end of the CDC's estimated range, closer to 1%, which is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. In the end, the post wrongly suggests that health officials have established COVID-19's true mortality rate and selectively picks the low-end of a range of estimates. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE - The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.","Determining the death rate of COVID-19 is a big challenge, especially at this still-early stage in the pandemic. Health officials and epidemiologists say there are many unknowns: How many people got infected but were never tested? How many died of the disease without being counted as coronavirus deaths? The answer is a moving target and at least one health expert believes it could be many months before a precise mortality rate is known. 'We won't know until a year from now,' said Thomas Novotny, professor emeritus of epidemiology and biostatistics at San Diego State University. 'There's so much we don't know.' That uncertainty, however, hasn't stopped claims from catapulting across social media saying the severity of the virus was overblown. Posts cut and pasted and shared thousands of times on Facebook and Instagram say: 'The CDC just confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19,' suggesting the rate is far lower than officials previously reported. The posts also claim that government officials misled the public about the number of coronavirus deaths and argue that closing down the economy wasn't necessary. This is a screenshot of one of the many misleading and widely spread Facebook posts that claims the CDC 'confirmed' a 0.2% mortality rate for COVID-19. The federal agency hasn't established a mortality rate for the disease. Several of these posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed (Read more about PolitiFact California's partnership with Facebook). The posts, some of which implore readers to 'make this viral,' include multiple misleading and false statements. But for this fact check, we decided to focus on whether the CDC has really 'confirmed' a 0.2% mortality rate and to offer some context on the lethality of the virus. We will base our rating on that specific claim. Background On Mortality Figures On March 3, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died. That figure is what epidemiologists call a 'case fatality rate.' The ratio is 'crudely calculated by dividing the number of reported deaths over the number of reported confirmed cases,' Carla Drysdale, a WHO spokeswoman, told PolitiFact National in March. She also said the ratio would change over time and vary from place to place. But the mortality rate, or 'death rate' as the Facebook posts terms it, is much more difficult to determine. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who die from COVID-19 in a certain geographic area by the total estimated number of people infected. It doesn't rely solely on confirmed deaths and infections. The biggest problem is the denominator. Many who develop mild cases of COVID-19 or show no signs at all are never tested and thus aren't counted, skewing the ratio. Did The CDC Really 'Confirm' A 0.2% Death Rate? The Facebook post's claim that the CDC 'confirmed' a 0.2% death rate draws on information in a planning document the federal agency published in May. The 0.2% figure is included, but it's the lowest in a range of five estimates. Earlier this month, USA Today analyzed the five scenarios in the document while fact-checking the same claim about a 0.2% death rate that had spread widely on Facebook and Instagram. 'The first four are varying estimates of the disease's severity, from low to high, while the fifth represents the 'current best estimate,'' USA Today reported. 'The range of estimates put the fatality rate for those showing symptoms between 0.2%-1%, with a 'best estimate' of 0.4%. It also places the number of asymptomatic cases between 20%-50%, with a 'best estimate' of 35%. By combining the two estimates, the estimated overall fatality rate of those infected with the virus - with and without symptoms - would be 0.26%.' The USA Today fact check concluded that saying the CDC has 'confirmed' 0.2% as the death rate 'paints a misleading picture because the CDC has clearly stated the number is subject to change. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the claim in the social media posts is simply 'wrong. The CDC did not confirm that.' He estimated COVID-19's death rate at 'between 0.8% and 1.0%.' 'No serious examination of the data from this pandemic would lead one to conclude that 0.2% is a realistic possibility,' Jha wrote in an email. The Facebook posts also attribute several quotes to 'the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.' An online search shows Jha made similar statements, but on a completely separate topic. 'This is pretty stunning to me - my quote being misused to promote a falsehood,' Jha said, noting he had not been aware of the posts before being contacted by PolitiFact California. Several health experts have described the CDC estimates as low and lacking in transparency. Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, questioned the CDC's 0.26% mortality rate, saying 'it's not transparent where that comes from.' 'That's very much on the low-end of what's been reported by good studies,' he added. The CDC did not respond to a request for comment. Health officials have cited a May study from the University of Washington, which estimated that if all infections were known, the true death rate for Americans who show symptoms would be about 1.3%. From a public health perspective, Jewell said that claims like the one spreading on Facebook can 'do a lot of damage, largely because when it's seized on, it undercuts your message' to continue social distancing and wearing masks. 'The whole idea that this wasn't so bad is just, in my view, nonsense,' Jewell said. Asked about the mortality rate claim in the Facebook posts, Novotny, the professor of epidemiology at San Diego State University, said 'it misrepresents what the risks are.' Comparing COVID 19's Mortality Rate To Influenza In March, Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact National that most experts believe the ultimate death rate for this coronavirus will wind up being higher than the rate for seasonal flu, which hovers around 0.1%. That lines up with what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress during his March testimony. 'The percent mortality will depend on what the denominator of number of cases is,' Fauci said. 'So if you're not counting every case, the mortality will be high. If you are counting a lot of cases that are sub-clinical, mortality will become low. But no matter how you slice it, it's many, many, many more times lethal than the influenza that we get in the season.'",,,,'The CDC just confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19.,refuted,barely-true,<p>The CDC has not 'confirmed' any mortality rate for COVID-19.</p>,politifact

In May, the Garden State had an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent, marking the fifth-highest amount among the 50 states. New Jersey's unemployment rate also was higher than the national employment rate by one percentage point and greater than the rates in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.","As Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic legislators battle over cutting taxes for the fiscal year beginning Sunday, both sides have been turning to federal labor statistics to make their case.

Christie received a False on the Truth-O-Meter for claiming that job growth represented 25 percent of the net new jobs created nationwide that month. The Democrat-controlled Legislature on Monday approved a fiscal year 2013 budget that sets aside $183 million for a tax cut, but said taxes only would be reduced if Christie's revenue projections are met between now and December. While discussing how the projections appear to be 'overly optimistic,' state Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) cited New Jersey's unemployment rate.

But while McCain can rightly take credit for the details of his proposal, he is by no means alone with the idea of having the federal government buy mortgages directly. We rate his statement Mostly True.","In a debate that featured rehashed candidate positions, one new policy emerged: Sen. John McCain's proposal to have the government buy and renegotiate what his top adviser later said would be 'literally millions' of mortgages on houses whose values have dropped and whose owners are struggling to keep up with payments. Taxpayers would cover the difference between the original loan and the new one, at a cost the McCain campaign estimated to be at $300-billion. 'Is it expensive? Yes,' McCain said during the debate on Oct. 7, 2008. 'But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.' In announcing the plan amid the question-and-answer of a town hall meeting, McCain sought to make clear that this was a bold, new idea all his own: 'And it's my proposal, it's not Sen. Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.' The question is whether or not McCain's proposal is as original as he claims. But first, some details on the plan. 'Mechanically, the initiative is very simple,' said Doug Holtz-Eakin, senior policy adviser for the McCain campaign. 'A home­owner would initiate the process by calling a mortgage broker or other originator and basically saying, 'I'd like to refinance my home,' and they would start the underwriting process, verify incomes.' The government loans would be available to mortgage holders who: • Live in the home as a primary residence. • Can prove their creditworthiness (and made a down payment at the time of the purchase). The FHA would then issue a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at a rate Holtz-Eakin estimated would be 'in the low 5 percent' range. Mortgage rates for 30-year fixed home loans are currently about 5.82 percent. Taxpayers would pick up the difference between the value of the two loans. While at least part of the expense of McCain's plan would be borne by the recently approved $700-billion bailout plan, the initiative also would tap some of the $300-billion tied to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act passed this summer. That's a plan that seeks to refinance loans for low- to moderate-income homeowners struggling to pay for homes they bought for more than they are now worth. The McCain plan outlines a dramatic shift in emphasis for the $700-billion bailout plan. While the bailout contained provisions to allow the Treasury to purchase mortgages directly, the legislation primarily was intended as a means for the government to buy troubled assets from financial institutions that might otherwise fail and that could later be sold when the markets recover. The hope, said Holtz-Eakin, is that McCain's 'bottom level up' plan will offset the need for some of that $700-billion. When McCain announced the plan at the debate, Obama supporters were quick to note that Obama had in previous weeks recommended that the bailout plan include the option of buying individual mortgages. 'We can't simply bail out Wall Street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are facing foreclosure - or, for that matter, are seeing their home values decline,' Obama said. McCain argued, during the debate and afterward, that his proposal is nothing like what Obama talked about. And after hearing details the next day, the Obama campaign agreed with McCain. Obama has always supported plans to have the government buy loans at market prices (in other words, the loan companies would have to swallow some loss), said Obama campaign economic policy director Jason Furman. And homeowners would have to share some of the profits should the value of the home rise. But McCain's proposal wouldn't do either of those things. The government would refinance homes at their new, lower value and absorb the loss in propoerty values entirely. Okay, so who's idea is it? Charlie Black, a senior adviser to McCain, told the New York Times the mortgage renewal idea actually originated with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who borrowed it from a Depression-era New Deal agency, the Home Owner's Loan Corp. Clinton spoke about her plan before Congress on Sept. 18, 2008. 'A new government entity like the HOLC with a focus on attacking the source of the problem can serve the purpose of clearing a lot of those toxic mortgage securities from the market,' Clinton said. 'We know there will not be any semblance of a normal or orderly marketplace until we have found a way to resolve these mortgage securities that are metastasizing in the bottom of our markets. By taking this paper out of the market and quarantining it in this new entity we will be able to give the market breathing room to recover. We will also be able to set the stage for an orderly sale of these securities and in turn allow some of them to recover and actually regain some of their value. Perhaps just as importantly, not only would our financial markets stabilize but so would our housing markets.' Although Clinton did not offer specifics of her plan, she seemed to suggest that it would entail buying mortgages at discounted current market rates, and that taxpayers might ultimately turn a profit on them. That's not McCain's plan. So here's where we stand: It's true that terms of the $700-billion bailout plan first initiated by President Bush contains authority for the Treasury to purchase mortgages directly. And it's true that Obama has called for a component of the buyout plan to include direct purchase of mortgages to alleviate homeowners struggling to make payments. Finally, it's true that Clinton sketched out a plan last spring that shared some of the goals and traits of McCain's proposal. The method McCain proposes - buying mortgages at their original value and renegotiating at the current market value (with taxpayers picking up the difference) - is indeed new. But while McCain can rightly take credit for the details of his proposal, he is by no means alone with the idea of having the federal government buy mortgages directly.

In fact, he understates the share of our trade deficit with nations that don't have free-trade agreements with the U.S. We rate Brady's statement Mostly True.","U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, last month spoke in support of creating an Emergency Trade Deficit Commission, while noting his hopes for congressional ratification of trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. 'The world has changed,' Brady said on the House floor July 28. 'It's not enough to simply buy American; we have to sell American, sell our products and goods and services throughout this world. And in fact, over 80 percent of our trade deficit today is with countries that are not trade agreement partners, that are not level playing fields for the United States; that's why we push hard for those agreements.' The 80 percent figure jarred a reader who urged us to give it a once-over; happy to oblige. Some background: In June, the U.S. trade deficit reached nearly $50 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Exports in June totaled $150.5 billion, imports $200.3 billion. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the United States has free-trade agreements - meaning neither country imposes trade restrictions such as tariffs - with 17 nations, which together account for 34 percent of U.S. imports and exports. The countries are Israel, Canada, Mexico, Jordan, Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Bahrain, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Oman and Peru. Through participation in the World Trade Organization, the United States has agreements permitting some restrictions with many nations. These include export powerhouses such as China, which from January through June 2010 was the leading exporter to the United States, with $161 billion in exported goods, according to the Census Bureau. China was followed in the exports-to-USA category by Canada, Mexico and Japan. And what of Brady's 'more than 80 percent' breakout? Joe Kafchinski, a bureau statistician, said that from January through June, 13 percent of the nation's trade deficit involved the countries that have free-trade agreements with the United States - meaning 87 percent of the deficit was with nations without such agreements. Next, we wondered about Brady's statement that those agreements serve to 'level the playing field' with other countries, trade-wise - and thus reduce the U.S. trade deficit. The National Association of Manufacturers says free-trade agreements ease the export of American goods: 'Free trade agreements (FTAs) account for nearly one-half of U.S. manufactured goods exports,' the association says on its website. 'They lower the price for consumer goods in the United States as well as the costs U.S. businesses pay for imported materials. Bilateral deals also open foreign markets to U.S. goods, increasing employment in those export sectors.' The manufacturers note that the Census Bureau 'reports that over the past two years, U.S. manufacturers had a $50 billion surplus with their counterparts in FTA partner countries. Conversely, in the same time period, the U.S. trade deficit in manufacturing goods with the rest of the world was an astounding $820 billion.' Put another way, the group says, 95 percent of the nation's manufactured-goods' deficit is with nations that do not have free-trade agreements with the United States. For labor's perspective, we contacted Jeff Vogt, global economic policy specialist for the AFL-CIO. Vogt said China's 2001 entry into the WTO drove up the U.S. deficit with non-free-trade nations. Regardless of which countries account for the deficit, Vogt said, the imbalance is a problem because the domestic economy benefits more from exports than imports. Vogt shared a March 2010 report by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, which focuses on the economic needs of low- and middle-income Americans. The report says the U.S. trade deficit with China increased $186 billion between 2001 and 2008. 'Rapidly growing imports of computer and electronic parts (including computers, parts, semiconductors, and audio-video equipment) accounted for more than 40 percent' of the surge, the report says, with deficits in advanced technology products responsible for 27 percent of the U.S.-China deficit. Also, according to the report, the growth of the deficit contributed to the loss of 627,700 U.S. jobs in computer and electronic products, along with other hard-hit industrial sectors including apparel and accessories (150,200 jobs), miscellaneous manufac­tured goods (136,900) and fabricated metal products (108,700). But trade agreements are not all that's behind the deficit with China. The report says a major cause 'is currency manipulation. Unlike other currencies, the Chinese yuan does not fluctuate freely against the dollar,' giving Chinese-made goods an artificial price advantage overseas. In June 2010, China's central bank announced that it would allow the yuan to fluctuate more, but the value of the yuan has since increased less than 1 percent, according to a news report posted online this week by FinanceAsia. Robert Scott, an economist at the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute in Washington, cautioned against presuming that free-trade agreements benefit the United States, saying that depends in part on whether the other nation is as developed as the United States and has open markets. For instance, the U.S. runs a trade deficit with its free-trade neighbor Mexico, he said, dominated by a flow of manufacturing plants to the less-developed country. Free-trade agreements, Scott said, are 'designed to make the world safe for multinationals to outsource production forever.' And in a July 1 article on the institute's website that criticized the proposed trade agreement with South Korea as 'foolish,' Scott wrote: 'History shows that such trade deals lead to rapidly growing trade deficits and job loss in the United States.' Clearly, there's a difference of opinion on whether free-trade agreements are a good thing vis-a-vis the growing U.S. trade deficit, as Brady asserts. But the key statistic in Brady's statement stands up. In fact, he understates the share of our trade deficit with nations that don't have free-trade agreements with the U.S. We rate Brady's statement Mostly True.",,,,"'Over 80 percent of our trade deficit today is with countries that are not trade agreement partners, that are not level playing fields for the United States.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact
20582,9034,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-trudeau-canada-american-farmers/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"As a trade war between the United States and Canada continued to escalate in June 2018, hyperpartisan social media pages started sharing a meme with the claim that it uses an actual quote spoken by Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau: 'We don't need US farmers anymore, we have grocery stores.' This quote was completely invented - apparently from whole cloth - in order to paint Canada's leader as ignorant and give bots and trolls fodder with which to criticize the international community in defense of President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. This quote seemingly originated in a thread on QAnon.news, a web site dedicated to a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory dealing in everything from 'PizzaGate' to the 'Illuminati' to the 'Deep State,' and which bears a suspicious resemblance to the hall-of-mirrors style of Kremlin disinformation apparently aimed at weakening the relationships between the United States and its allies. Vice provides a brief summary of the QAnon conspiracy theory: Who or what is QAnon? Just asking that question sucks you into a world that's like Pizzagate on bath salts, a galaxy-brained, 4chan-bred conspiracy theory that has apparently convinced an alarming number of adults that all kinds of preposterous things are true. [...] Wielding the plausible-enough-sounding details and sprawling shadow government plot of a lesser Dan Brown novel, Q began slowly painting a picture of a reality far different from the one we live in. The resulting QAnon conspiracy theory states that Trump is not under investigation by Robert Mueller. Instead, Trump is merely playing the part of hapless conspiratorial criminal while covertly helping the special counsel pursue their true quarry: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, and all the other liberal boogeymen. (It gets a LOT crazier than that, but that's the core plot.) The phrase attached to Justin Trudeau was originally posted as a joke by someone completely unrelated to the prime minister. That attribution came later, when another user suggested that the phrase was 'meme material': Conspiracy-minded forums of this ilk constantly push users to spread memes containing disinformation on the internet in order to 'wake up the normies.' This thread was no different. One post read in part: Meme and Meme and Meme some MOAR! Your memes are what's waking up the normies. Hit them hard, from all angles, with every meme you have, RT others tweets. KEEP GOING! Be your own tweet storm army. Sure enough, within a few days of this thread images containing a picture of Justin Trudeau and the fictional quote appeared; true to form, the usual suspects began pushing the fake quote as real: Regardless of what one might think of Canadian trade policies, it is safe to assume that Canada's political leader understands that grocery stores get their products from outside sources. Nearly identical smears have been used to target other politicians. So far, we've come across at least two other memes which placed this fabricated quote into the mouths of Democratic politicians Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Stacey Abrams:",Did Canada's Prime Minister Say Canadians Don't Need American Farmers Because 'We Have Grocery Stores'?

The electoral results leave little doubt that Trump expanded Republican success compared to Romney's baseline in many corners of the country. However, it's important not to overstate the importance of the statistic Pence cited. Clinton may have won fewer counties overall, but the ones she did win tended to be much more populous and economically dynamic. The statement is accurate, but it needs an asterisk, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea7c6f37-927c-4edc-9de7-f78fd53257aa","With a split in the 2016 Electoral College and popular votes, there's been an unusual amount of jockeying this year over how to frame the Election Day results. On the Dec. 4, 2016, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Vice President-elect Mike Pence used the yardstick of counties won to explain why Donald Trump's victory was a watershed. 'To be around Donald Trump, as you know, having known him for a number of years, is to be around a man of boundless energy from literally the day after the election,' he said, 'a historic election where he won 30 out of 50 states (and) more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan.' Is this correct? It is, though election experts say it speaks to longtime Republican dominance in rural areas. A closer look at the numbers We were able to secure statistics for counties won by each presidential candidate from Dave Leip, creator of the indispensable 'Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections' website. The following chart shows the breakdown in counties won by each party's nominee going back to 1984, which was Reagan's last election as well as the one in which he won every state except one (Minnesota). Two housekeeping notes: The data for 2016 is preliminary, and Alaska doesn't calculate vote data by borough, which is that state's equivalent of a county. So Pence is on target that the number of counties won by Trump exceeds the number of counties won by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan in 1984. For a more visual look, here are maps showing the counties won by the parties in each of those elections. Note that the 2016 map, from the Washington Post, uses the now-traditional Democratic blue-Republican red color scheme. 2016 The rest of the maps, from Leip's website, use blue coloring for Republican counties and red coloring for Democratic counties. (For the record, Leip started using his coloring code in 1994, before the current version became standard; he says that changing every map on his site would require an enormous time commitment.) 2012 2008 2004 2000 1996 1992 1988 1984 Trump receives credit from electoral specialists for expanding the Republican footprint, notably in places that had previously backed Barack Obama. According to a calculation by Time magazine, Trump won 220 counties that had voted for Obama in 2012, while Hillary Clinton took far fewer -- 17 -- that had gone for Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. And Trump outperformed Romney's vote share in 2,728 counties, compared to just 383 where Clinton outperformed Obama. But the places where Clinton performed better than Obama did were almost always in much more populous counties. According to Time's calculations, the counties where Clinton gained ground on Obama had a median of 75,554 voters in 2016. The comparable figure for the counties where Trump exceeded Romney's performance was 9,905 voters. So the median Clinton-trending county was more than seven times bigger than the median Trump-trending county. The divide doesn't stop at population. Mark Muro and Sifan Liu of the Brookings Institution crunched the numbers on the overall economic output of Clinton and Trump counties. Their finding? Clinton's comparatively tiny number of counties 'encompassed a massive 64 percent of America's economic activity,' compared to 36 percent for Trump's much larger stable of counties. Here's a graphical representation of what they found, with Clinton counties in blue and Trump counties in red, and each county's rectangle scaled to the size of the output in that county: 'Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country,' the authors wrote. 'Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties.' All of this illustrates a general pattern for Democrats in recent election cycles: They have run strongly in populous and economically growing urban and suburban areas, but poorly in lightly populated rural areas. This has been true for the entire period we're looking at -- in fact, Bill Clinton never managed to win more counties during his two victories in the 1990s -- but the partisan disparity has been growing steadily. And the pattern reached a new apogee with the Trump vs. Clinton race. This helps explain why Clinton has so far won 2.6 million more votes than Trump did -- almost 2 percentage points more -- while losing so many counties. 'Loving County, Texas, has a population of 82, while California's Los Angeles County has over 9.8 million,' said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. 'The number of counties won is not necessarily a meaningful indicator, absent any consideration of the population of these counties.' Seth Masket, a University of Denver political scientist, agreed. 'Partisanship increasingly correlates with urbanism,' he said. 'There are a lot more rural counties than urban ones, so I'd expect Republicans to be winning more and more counties over time. So the claim that the GOP is winning more counties is possibly an interesting reflection on residential living patterns, but it doesn't really reflect what the voters wanted or what the government has a mandate to address.'",,,,Says Donald Trump 'won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Bush took New Jersey in 1988 with more than 56 percent of the vote, defeating Democratic rival Michael Dukakis to secure a spot in the White House.

The law firm describes itself as a 'state-of-the-art litigation law firm dedicated to the lost art of combat by trial,' with past clients including U.S. President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Next, we used the State Bar of California's database of attorneys to find out if Pierce had an active license to practice law in the state. He did, as of this report. After that, we sought evidence to determine whether he was among defending attorneys representing Rittenhouse, who faces charges including first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a life sentence. Snopes found reports from media outlets including Reuters, the Chicago Sun-Times, Business Insider, WISN 12-Milwaukee, and Fox News, that indeed named Pierce as an attorney fighting the teenager's charges. The Reuters report stated: 'John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at Pierce Bainbridge would obtain justice for Kyle Rittenhouse ...' As more proof, Pierce said on Twitter that he was 'coordinating a whole special forces team to HALO jump in' regarding Rittenhouse's case.

Candidates for governor made numerous assertions about the scale of California's homeless population on March 8, 2018 during a housing forum in Sacramento. Here's how GOP candidate and Orange County Assemblyman Travis Allen portrayed the depths of California's human emergency: 'Homelessness has skyrocketed across California. We have the nation's highest homelessness rate and the nation's highest homeless population.' The state has wrestled with this topic for decades, but has homelessness really 'skyrocketed'? And how does its per capita and overall homeless population compare with other states? We set out on a fact check. Our research We found answers in a December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: The 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress. It includes a state-by-state comparison of homeless populations based on a one-night count in each state in January 2017. The report tallies per capita homeless rates and total homeless populations along with comprehensive sets of demographic data. Sharon Rapport, associate director for California policy at the Corporation for Supportive Housing, described the report as 'the most authoritative' resource on the topic. CSH is a national organization that develops housing policy and makes housing loans. She noted the HUD report is a snapshot of how many people are homeless at any given time. Her organization estimates the number of people who are homeless for at least part of a year is two to three times higher than any point-in-time tally. Has homelessness 'skyrocketed' in California? The report shows California's homeless population jumped nearly 14 percent from 2016 to 2017 - to a total of more than 134,00 people. It rose nearly 9 percent over the previous seven years. That's much different than the national picture. While the national homeless population ticked up about 1 percent in 2017, it remained 13 percent lower than in 2010, according to an NPR analysis following the report's release. Notably, the rise statewide and nationally in 2017 was attributed to a surge in the number of people living on the streets in Los Angeles and other West Coast cities, at least in part due to a shortage of affordable housing. Compared to the nation's relatively small increase, Allen is on track when he says California's homeless population has 'skyrocketed.' How would Allen tackle the problem? 'We need more state run mental institutions,' the lawmaker said at the forum. The institutions would offer the homeless substance abuse and psychiatric services, he said, 'so they can get back on their feet and re-enter the workforce.' This Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016 file photo Eddie, 51, a homeless man who would only give his first name and lives in a tent on the street in downtown Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Does California have the nation's highest homelessness rate? On this point, Allen is slightly off target. While the 2017 HUD report shows California's per capita homeless rate is high, it's not the highest. California has the third highest rate nationally with 34 in every 10,000 people in the state experiencing homelessness. Two states are worse off: New York and Hawaii. New York ranks second with 45 homeless people per 10,000. Hawaii, meanwhile, ranks first with 51 per 10,000. Does California have the highest homeless population in the nation? Allen is again correct on this part of his statement. The HUD report lists California's total homeless population at 134,278. That's about one quarter of the national homeless population of 553,742. New York was a distant second with 89,503 followed by Florida with 32,190.

As a state, our per capita rate is amongst the highest, but it is not the highest,' Rapport, of Corporation for Supportive Housing, summarized in an email.",,,,'Homelessness has skyrocketed across California.

The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard. So we rate the statement Mostly True.","After decades of fits and starts, Hillsborough County commissioners agreed to ask voters to consider a 1 percent sales tax increase for expanded bus service, light rail and road improvements. The issue will appear on the November ballot. One question many voters want answered: How much will the new tax cost me? In a brochure outlining how rapid transit can boost the economy and ease traffic congestion, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit says the tax will cost the average family $12 a month. That figure comes from the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization's long-range transportation plan. It puts the cost of a 1 cent sales tax for the average family at $142 a year, and the average for a single person at $85 a year. The MPO came up with those numbers by plugging the county's household incomes into the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, available on the agency's Web site. The IRS developed the calculator because tax rules allow people to deduct either sales taxes paid annually or state income tax from their federal returns, and the calculator enables them to arrive at a reasonable estimate without having to save a basket of receipts. MPO planner Beth Alden said she used average household income rather than median income. 'The number we've been using is the higher one, just to be more conservative,' she said. The county's average family of three has a household income of $77,852, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A single household's average income is $44,832. We plugged those figures into the IRS calculator and it showed the average family would pay $141.83 a year in local sales tax, which currently is 1 percent. A single person would pay $91.50. That's virtually the same as the MPO estimates. The figure does not include sales taxes on major purchases, such as cars, mobile homes or construction materials for a house. Those are listed separately on tax returns. The county sales tax on items worth more than $5,000 is capped, meaning the maximum amount paid on any single item would be $50. But how accurate is the IRS calculator? Skeptical observers say it spits out a low figure. 'It's in the IRS' interest to have that on the lower end, obviously, to decrease the deductions,' said Rusty Spoor, a tax accountant at Foley & Lardner. He guessed the calculator could be as much as 30 percent off. Like other tax experts, he noted it's impossible to determine exactly how much people pay a year in sales taxes without saving receipts, so the IRS calculator is a useful tool. 'That's the best of the poorest options,' he said. 'I don't think that number's great, but it's the best starting point.' The calculator is based on spending patterns captured in the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski said. That's the best method for calculating how much people pay in sales tax, according to Frank Williams, chief economist for the Florida Department of Revenue's Office of Tax Research. 'It should be fairly close,' he said. 'It may understate it by 2 to 5 percent, but that's just a gut feel.' Opponents of the sales tax say it will cost residents much more than the MPO estimates. Jim Hosler, a demographer running for Hillsborough County commissioner, initially figured it would cost households nearly $400 a year. He came up with that number by dividing the estimated revenue from the tax - about $174 million, according to the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations - by 454,000, the approximate number of households in Hillsborough County. That comes about $383. Trouble is, residents aren't the only ones who pay sales taxes. Tourists, commuters and businesses also pay them. Experts say there's no way to know exactly who pays what, but most estimate that non-residents bear about 20 percent of the tax burden. Under that calculation, the cost is $307 per household. But that spreads out sales taxes equally among all households, regardless of income. And a household that earns $200,000 a year will pay much more in sales taxes than a $20,000 household, simply by virtue of having more disposable income. Hosler concedes his number may be high. 'But their number is definitely a low number,' he said. 'The real number is probably somewhere in between.' Clearly there are a number of ways to calculate the figure, and the result for all of them is a somewhat imprecise. Still, our research shows that the number in the brochure is very close to the one provided by the MPO, and HART used a recognized, legitimate source in coming up with the figure. The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard.

The wage was bifurcated then. The majority earning $1.60 an hour could support a family of three, but a small group of workers qualifying for $1.15 an hour would have lived below the poverty line The second part of the center's claim -- that a full-time worker today could not raise a family of two on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour -- holds up. Clearly, the buying power of the minimum wage has decreased in recent decades. The center tried to illustrate that point with a statement that is accurate but needs a little clarification. So we rate its claim Mostly True.","Pro and con, about a dozen speakers came forward last month when the House of Delegates Commerce and Labor Committee invited comment on bills to raise Virginia's minimum wage. Robin Gahan, the director of programs at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, urged an increase, saying families can't get by on the bottom rate of $7.25 an hour, which is also the national floor. 'In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage could actually support a family of three above the poverty line,' Gahan said. 'Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two.' The Republican-controlled committee went on to kill three bills this winter that would have increased the minimum wage, maintaining that raising the rate would force employers to cut jobs. But the issue remains alive in Washington, where the U.S. Senate this spring is expected to vote on legislation that would raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. So we looked into the Interfaith Center's claim. Gahan pointed us to a December 2013 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that advocates boosting the wage. A graph measures the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels. In 1968, the minimum wage for most workers was $1.60 an hour. An employee working at that rate for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have earned $3,328. That was above the poverty thresholds that year for a three person-household: $2,817 annually for a home headed by a man and $2,516 for a home headed by a woman. The minimum wage was bifurcated back then, however, and a small group of employees -- including workers at schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels and motels -- could be paid as little as $1.15 an hour. Those employees, working full time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household. Congress ended the dual minimum wages in 1978. Now, let's move forward to modern times. The $7.25 hourly minimum was established in 2009. A full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year. That falls slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two, which is $15,156. There are a few details about all these numbers that should be noted: In the 1960s and 1970s, the yearly earnings for full-time minimum wage workers skirted the poverty line for supporting a family of three. It rose above when the wage was increased and fell below when the new rate languished for a few years. The minimum wage has not supported a family of three above the poverty line since 1980. The minimum wage has supported a household of two above the poverty line only during six years since 1984. The longest run came from 2009 through 2012, after the wage was raised 70 cents an hour to its current rate of $7.25. In 1968, the year cited by the Interfaith Center to begin its comparison, the buying power of most minimum wage workers was at an all-time high, according to the Congressional Research Service. The $1.60 an hour rate paid to most of the earners, when adjusted for inflation, translates to $10.75 an hour today.",,,,"'In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage, could actually support a family of three above the poverty line.

On March 24, 2021, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer criticized state legislatures for working on laws that he argued would disenfranchise Black voters, specifically by limiting voting on Sunday, a day when churches with majority Black congregations host events like Souls to the Polls. He received a rebuke from Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, which soon went viral. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Georgia says voting on Sunday is wrong because it's the Sabbath, dedicated to God. Better cancel football and baseball, then. - Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 24, 2021 In the above tweet, author Stephen King incorrectly said Hyde-Smith is a Georgia senator, when in fact, she represents Mississippi. But on March 24, 2021, Hyde-Smith did express the sentiment in so many words that states should not hold voter events on Sunday because it is the Sabbath. She was responding to Schumer, who had criticized Georgia lawmakers for attempting to suppress early voting on Sundays, which would specifically affect Black communities whose churches have a history of using Sundays to encourage voters to cast their ballots. Schumer said: 'Why did the Georgia legislature only pick Sundays to say there should be no early voting on Sunday? We know why. It's because that's the day African Americans vote in the 'Souls to the Poll' operation where they go from church to vote. It's despicable.' Later, during a Senate Committee hearing, Hyde-Smith said she wanted to address Schumer's comments. Her full remarks: Senator Schumer's question was, he was wondering why on Sundays, Georgia would not participate in an electoral process of gathering signatures of registration and things on Sunday and I would just like to respond to that. Georgia is a southern state just like Mississippi. I cannot speak for Georgia, but I can speak for Mississippi on why we would never do that on a Sunday or hold an election on a Sunday. [Holds up a dollar bill] You know this is our currency, this is a dollar bill. This says, 'The United States of America In God We Trust.' Etched in stone in the U.S. Senate chamber is 'In God We Trust.' When you swore in all of these witnesses, the last thing you said to them in your instructions was, 'so help you God.' In God's word in Exodus 20:18. it says remember the Sabbath, and keep it holy. So that is my response to Senator Schumer. Schumer responded that observing the Sabbath on Sundays is not, strictly speaking, biblical, if one is citing the Old Testament as one's source. 'I'll start by reminding my colleague of the separation between church and state,' Schumer said on the Senate floor, 'and frankly, the Bible passage she talked about comes from the Old Testament when the Sabbath was on Saturday.' Indeed, Jews still observe the Sabbath on Saturdays, as do Seventh-Day Adventists and several other Christian denominations. Hyde-Smith made her remarks around 25 seconds into the video below: She clearly stated that Mississippi would not hold election events on Sundays because of the Sabbath, and that the day should be devoted to God. Since this debate, legislators in Georgia backed down on restricting early voting on Sundays. The current version of legislation now requires that during the three-week early voting period in the state, counties would be required to offer early voting on the two Saturdays in that period, and makes it optional on Sundays. While Hyde-Smith did not explicitly say the words paraphrased in Stephen King's tweet, she expressed the same sentiment. We rate this claim as 'True.'Recent Updates Update [March 26, 2021]: Added Schumer's rebuttal concerning the the Old Testament's version of the Sabbath. ",Did Sen.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that government spending has reached a tipping point. 'We face a crushing burden of debt,' Ryan said. 'The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in years ahead.' We at PolitiFact and our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio have both considered essentially identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The most recent of those statements, which came during a speech in the House of Representatives on Jan. 5, 2011, was that 'our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy.' In its most basic interpretation, the United States government's total debt at the start of the year was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department's interactive 'Debt to the Penny' website. The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis databases. Using these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury's calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. That means $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy, which to us signals the onset of an eclipse. Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, 'Wait!' We understand. There is an alternative measure of debt known as 'public debt,' which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Using this measure instead, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent. If current practices aren't changed, public debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama's national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December. Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector. But one measure 'isn't more 'right' than the other,' Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, told us last March. 'Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don't think he's misrepresenting in any way.' Even if the smaller number -- public debt -- were to approach a total eclipse in a decade, 'to me, that counts as 'soon,'' said Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. That's because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions 'to turn the budget ship around,' he said. We'll note that these numbers have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent.

The post was published on the networking site LinkedIn and has since gone viral. Managadze wrote, in part: Dear University of Maryland, I was your Valedictorian until about a month ago and almost gave the Main Commencement Speech at graduation, but instead of giving the speech, I decided to follow my dreams, fail all my classes this semester, and drop out of school two weeks before graduation without getting a degree. If you would like to know why your Valedictorian dropped out of school, you're welcome to read my email to my parents below: Dear Mom and Dad, I finally found my destiny this semester in college. I have finally understood how leadership, happiness, and fearlessness actually work. Leadership is very simple. All you need to have is a lot of confidence and a lot of empathy both at the same time. You need confidence to know what you want to do and do it. You need empathy to understand other people's perspectives, emotions, wants, and desires so you can lead them and help them achieve their goals. You make yourself happy and you make everybody around you happy. You can't have confidence without emotional intelligence or emotional intelligence without confidence. You need both. ... This semester I have finally understood that my true passion and dream is to become a self made entrepreneur. A CEO. The entire post, which is more than 3,000 words long, can be read here. We were able to confirm with the University of Maryland that Managadze was a student there; however, a spokeswoman told us that the university doesn't recognize valedictorians. Three speakers were scheduled to speak during the 21 May 2017 commencement ceremony and none of them were Managadze. Student speakers were Shuping Yang, a double major in theater and psychology, and Gregory Ridgway, a triple major in physics, mathematics and piano performance. Since posting the screed, Managadze has walked back some of the claims. In a 23 May 2017 Facebook post, he seemed to admit he had written inaccurate information, but said his original post was 'an experiment with marketing,' writing: Some public inconsistencies have come to my attention... Does UMD only have one Valedictorian? Nope. Does Gio know other people's GPAs? Nope. Could Gio give a graduation speech at the comp sci graduation commencement if he wanted to? Yup. Did he go through the application process for the speech? No need to. Did he decide to fail his classes before the speech? Yup. Did he actually drop out of school two weeks before graduation? Yup. Is he actually gonna become an entrepreneur? Yup. Did he lie? Nope. Did Gio feel the absolute need to title his article 'The Valedictorian of UMD...' and use a crazy mind-boggling opener to try to make it go viral like no other because he was insanely inspired by the belief that the contents of his article were true to his heart, mind, and soul and needed to be shared with as many people as possible as soon as possible? Absolutely. Did he hurt others? Accidentally. What happens when we accidentally hurt others? Public apology and respect to Tyler Good Cohn, Gregory Ridgway and all other Valedictorians who felt in any way belittled by my article. Hurting you guys was absolutely not my intention. All I did was experiment with a little marketing to try to get my point across to the whole planet... Apparently it kinda worked... Apparently I also became a meme... You guys are real Valedictorians. I'm an Ex. We reached out to ask Managadze over Facebook Messenger to ask if he has been successful in his quest to become a CEO. He answered that he is 'doing a lot of reading and working on a bunch of different ideas.'

Bush correctly cites data from PISA showing the United States trails the three countries in question. But it's not so much that the United States has 'fallen behind' -- the U.S. has been behind Ireland and Poland for years, and Vietnam was first tested in 2012. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.","One part of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's resume sets him apart from many of the other potential Republican presidential contenders: a longstanding focus on education policy. As he travels around the country giving speeches -- and titillating political journalists and donors -- Bush has highlighted some of the education policies he advocated during his gubernatorial tenure, which relied heavily on achievement benchmarks, and chastised those who resisted. Bush likes to remind audiences how far Florida came on education benchmarks and how far the nation still has to go to raise its standards. During a May 12 speech at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, Bush said the U.S. lags behind other countries -- including some unexpected nations -- on some key educational measures. 'There is nothing more critical to our long-term economic security than a wholesale transformation of our education system,' Bush said. 'The latest results from the Program for International Student Assessment, better known as PISA, only confirm the urgency of our charge.' He continued, 'U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science. Between 2003 and 2012, the United States flatlined its results, but many other countries have made a command focus on this. ... There have been more resources placed in this, and they have higher expectations of their children, and they have gotten a better result. So for those that think ... poverty is the reason why we haven't had the educational gains, I guess we should really look to the wealthy countries like Vietnam to determine whether we should be successful. Come on!' We thought we'd check whether Bush was correct that teenagers in Ireland, Poland and Vietnam rank higher than their U.S. counterparts in math and science. International comparison data Bush cited the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which includes every member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group of advanced industrialized nations -- as well as some non-member countries. In the United States, PISA is conducted by the federal government's National Center for Education Statistics. The United States sampled schools nationwide. For the United States and the countries Bush cited, the data includes students at both public and private schools. PISA compares 15-year-olds from more than 60 countries in math, science and reading every three years. The study rates students' levels of proficiency between 1 and 6 -- with 6 being the highest. Nine percent of U.S. teenagers achieved the PISA math proficiency level 5 or higher, while in Poland it was 17 percent, Vietnam 13 percent and Ireland 11 percent. In science, 7 percent of U.S. teenagers achieved the PISA science proficiency level 5 or higher. In Poland and Ireland, 11 percent of teenagers hit that mark. In Vietnam, however, the percent hitting that proficiency level was 8. That's just one point above the United States, a level that's not considered 'measurably different,' according to a research analyst at NCES. Education experts weigh in on PISA We sent Bush's claim to a few education experts and asked whether they had any concerns about the PISA evaluations or Bush's interpretations of the data. 'Unfortunately (for the country), he is dead right,' said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of a book that includes a discussion of how such international test results are related to economic growth. 'I am convinced that it is a good index of important skills, particularly the math and science scores.' Jason Amos, a spokesman for the Alliance for Excellent Education, a policy organization that focuses on at-risk high school students, said Bush 'is citing PISA correctly.' University of Iowa education professor David Bills said, 'The big question for me is that the distribution in the U.S. is so different than the countries we're being compared with. The U.S. just tolerates a lot of really low achievement, overwhelmingly among poorer kids.' While top American students are internationally competitive, 'relative to other countries we badly underinvest in poor kids,' Bills said. 'That tends to bring the overall mean down, mainly because U.S. scores are just much more skewed than they are elsewhere.' Like any educational assessment, PISA does have its critics, and much of the criticism has focused on either a general backlash against the 'escalation of testing' or debate about whether PISA's No. 1 ranking of China stems from its focus on Shanghai, a comparatively wealthy city. Yong Zhao, University of Oregon education professor, has written several blog posts critical of PISA, saying the comparison 'glorifies educational authoritarianism.' Zhao told PolitiFact that the statistics cited by Bush are correct. However, he said that his statement that U.S. teenagers 'have now fallen behind' counterparts in Ireland, Poland and Vietnam is misleading. 'The U.S. PISA rankings were below Ireland and Poland in 2003, and Vietnam did not participate until 2012. So the U.S. has not fallen behind. ... in terms of international test scores, the U.S. has always had poor performance, behind many countries. So there is no 'falling behind.'

He offers as evidence Sanders' past visits to communist countries and statements praising communist leaders. But experts detail clear differences between Sanders' democratic socialism - which focuses on democratically achieved expansion of social welfare programs - and any commonly accepted definition of communism. Sanders isn't pushing for authoritarian rule, government ownership of all private property or an end to capitalism. We rate Walker's claim False.","In his life out of public office, Scott Walker is nothing if not direct. The former Republican governor of Wisconsin has been prolific on Twitter since leaving office, and he has recently turned his attention to Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. One word keeps coming up. 'Bernie is a Communist who admires Communist dictators and he should never be President of the United States of America,' Walker tweeted on Feb. 24, 2020. The label is hardly a first for Sanders. Walker also made the claim in a column and several earlier tweets, one of which invoked Sanders' oft-cited Soviet Union honeymoon. President Donald Trump said the same in a Feb. 2, 2020, interview before the Super Bowl. And former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg invoked communism while criticizing Sanders' monetary policy at the Feb. 19, 2020, Democratic primary debate. Seems like it's time to separate fact from rhetoric. Based on Sanders' political views, is he a communist? Defining political ideologies When we asked Walker for evidence of his claim, a spokesman cited a laundry list of past actions, including Sanders praising leaders of communist governments, visiting the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and traveling to several communist countries. For the record, PolitiFact National rated a claim that Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union Mostly True in 2015 . It wasn't exactly a traditional honeymoon, but Sanders and his wife left the day after their wedding to be part of a 12-person delegation for a sister city program between Burlington, Vt. - where Sanders was mayor - and the city of Yaroslavl. Fidel Castro was a diabolical dictator who Bernie Sanders praised because he had a great reading program. Bernie is a Communist who admires Communist dictators and he should never be President of the United States of America. 3/3 pic.twitter.com/0VEHXCKFy6- Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) February 24, 2020 As further support, Walker's spokesman, Jim Dick, described Sanders' socialist policies and cited a Vladimir Lenin quote that 'the goal of socialism is communism.' (Walker tweeted the same line shortly after this statement was sent to PolitiFact Wisconsin.) That's not exactly hard evidence. So let's dig deeper. Asking the experts Sanders has distinguished himself in the presidential field with a platform that calls for universal health care and free access to public colleges and universities. Sanders - an independent in the U.S. Senate - describes himself as a democratic socialist. And for the record, he has said he is not a communist, in responding to Trump's pre-Super Bowl assertion. Experts point to several clear dividing lines between Sanders' philosophy and communism - while unanimously calling Walker's label an exaggeration. Encyclopedia Britannica defines communism as a form of socialism, noting that Karl Marx and others in the 19th Century used the terms interchangeably. But the ideologies have diverged since, said Joshua Tucker, professor of politics at New York University. Socialism, as it plays out today in some European countries, is generally associated with a large social welfare state, including free healthcare and education, generous pensions and general 'cradle to grave' security. Communism on the other hand typically involves a one-party government that owns all property and controls the means of production. In other words, the government exerts a great deal of control over both economic and individual behavior. '(Under communist ideology) the state would own all the sort of large level companies - airports, factories, hospitals, all these sorts of things, and this is not what Sanders is talking about at all,' Tucker said. 'He does want to see the state playing more of a role in reducing inequality in society, and one of the ways you do that is providing more social welfare benefits.' The means of reaching the desired outcome is also a key split between modern democratic socialism and communism, said Russell Muirhead, a professor of political science at Dartmouth College. 'Democratic socialists are committed in the first case to persuading citizens of their particular policies and views, and if they can't persuade, they refuse to try to implement those policies. Democracy comes first,' he said in an email. 'Communists are so sure that they have the whole truth that they're willing to impose their policies even if they can't persuade other people, even if it requires a sustained and brutal application of violence. That's why we associate communism with tyranny.' Lowell Barrington, associate professor of political science at Marquette University, said Sanders has made himself 'vulnerable' to attacks like Walker's because he has spoken positively of communist leaders like Cuba's Fidel Castro. But he echoed others in saying Sanders' proposals are more in line with the northern European brand of socialism than the authoritarian communist regimes seen in the Soviet Union, Cuba and the People's Republic of China. Said Tucker: 'The bottom line is, the way we classically think about communism, there's no way you can call what Bernie Sanders is pushing for ... communism. That's scare-mongering.'",,,,'Bernie (Sanders) is a communist.,refuted,false,<p>Sanders visited the Soviet Union on a kinda-sorta honeymoon and has praised communist leaders in the past.</p>,politifact

Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here. In late June 2020, social media users shared an article written by anti-Muslim propagandist Robert Spencer in which he claimed - without evidence - that 'Antifa and Muslim organizations plan to 'police Minneapolis under Muslim rule.'' Spencer's article, which was published to the far-right website FrontPageMag, was sourced from a quote by State Rep. Steve Green, a Republican who represents a district in northwest Minnesota. Green made the comment among many other grievances he aired during a meeting with the Hubbard County Board of Commissioners on June 16, 2020. The remark was initially documented in a Park Rapids Enterprise post written by another politician, State Rep. Matt Grossell, a Republican representative for a district in northwest Minnesota who was also present at the meeting. Grossell's post reads like a partial transcript of the two men's remarks at the meeting, and contains no corroborating evidence or reporting to support Green's claims. At one point Green indicates that in his 'humble opinion,' they're seeing 'communism moving into Minneapolis and St. Paul.' Despite a lack of evidence to support it, Green's sensational quote was picked up by a number of websites. We reached out to Green by email to ask where he got this information and whether he had any evidence for his claims, but got no reply. We also reached out to Minneapolis Police Sgt. John Elder, who confirmed that while the City Council did state its intent to 'reimagine' policing, the Minneapolis Police Department is still operating. 'We absolutely are here and will not abandon our communities!' Elder stated in an email. Not only is there no apparent evidence for Green's claim that antifa and Muslim groups are policing Minneapolis, but the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on GOP leaders to repudiate Green's statement, calling it hate-filled. As the Minneapolis-based alternate newspaper CityPages reported, the Twin Cities are no stranger to Islamophobic rhetoric and violence: It should go without saying that, no, people are not trying to impose 'Muslim rule' on Minneapolis, but we kind of end up having to say it a lot. Back in April, as false rumors of mosques staying open during quarantine bounced around Facebook, Council on American-Islamic Relations executive director Jaylani Hussein called the spread of such conspiracies 'hate-bating.' They might seem harlmess [sic], even laughable, until someone gets hurt. And if watching a group of Illinois men blow up a Bloomington mosque in the summer of 2017 has taught Twin Cities' Muslim communities anything, it's that they very well can. Green's comments came in the aftermath of nationwide protests against structural racism and police violence after video of the in-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man, went viral in May 2020. The video showed Floyd begging for his life as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck. In the wake of sustained, international protests, Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder in Floyd's death, and three other officers at the scene were charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Minneapolis City Council also voted to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, stating it could not be reformed. However, that doesn't mean the police department disappeared overnight. Members of the City Council stated that the change would be gradual, and that they are still in the process of laying the groundwork for what the future holds for public safety in Minneapolis. As some of the earlier protests had turned violent, U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies had sought to blame 'antifa' without evidence. As The New York Times noted, 'antifa, a contraction of the phrase 'anti-fascist,' is not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles' but rather 'antifa is more of a movement of activists whose followers share a philosophy and tactics.' Because there's no evidence for Green's comments and because the Minneapolis Police Department continues to patrol the city and respond to emergencies as city leaders hash out the future for public safety, we rate this claim 'False.'","No, Antifa and Muslim Groups Aren't Policing Minneapolis Under 'Muslim Rule' The claim appears to have originated with a state representative who does not live in Minneapolis.

15195,2359,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-quote-kim-jong-un-biden/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"A trait North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un shares with U.S. President Donald Trump is a penchant for hurling sophomoric insults at perceived enemies and rivals, including each other. When Trump referred to Kim as 'Rocket Man' in a 2017 speech warning that the United States would 'totally destroy' North Korea if attacked by that country, Kim fired back that Trump is 'a mentally deranged U.S. dotard.' In May 2019, North Korea's state media agency appeared to take inspiration from Trump (who often uses the epithet 'individual of low IQ' to denigrate people he doesn't like) by calling Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden 'a fool of low IQ' in response to Biden's labeling Kim a 'tyrant.' Trump, who has himself publicly insulted Biden several times since the latter's entry into the 2020 presidential race, tweeted that he 'smiled when [Kim] called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?' Trump took it even further in a press conference during a state visit to Japan by agreeing with Kim's assessment of Biden, as reported below by the Associated Press: 'Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual,' Trump said. 'He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that.' Pressed on whether he was supporting a dictator over a former U.S. vice president, Trump recited a host of complaints about the Obama-Biden administration. U.S. officeholders have in the past generally avoided engaging in politics while on foreign soil, hewing to the adage that politics stops at the water's edge. But Trump's sharp attack on Biden, through his declaration of agreement with Kim, cast aside that tradition. Here is a video clip from that press conference: President Trump: 'Kim Jong un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that.' https://t.co/tzBI1eou2y pic.twitter.com/xRGewVfamp - The Hill (@thehill) May 28, 2019 Despite criticism from members of both parties for siding with a foreign leader against an American and airing his political grievances on the international stage, Trump would double down on his remarks, but not before a random tweet by a U.S. foreign policy expert nudged the controversy into fictional territory. On 26 May, Time columnist Ian Bremmer attributed the following quote to the president: Though some who read it questioned its authenticity, the attributed quote - 'Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden' - was initially accepted as real and shared on social media by anti-Trump partisans: President Trump in Tokyo: 'Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden.' Hey Evangelicals, here is a quick fun fact about Kim Jong Un: he currently has 50,000 Christians in Labor Concentration Camps.

That US traitor is the current @potus, Donald Trump Siding with a foreign enemy over a loyal US patriot, Joe Biden. Trump is unAmerican - Millgrist (@Millgrist1) May 26, 2019 However, in follow-up tweets, Bremmer implicitly acknowledged that he had fabricated the quote ('This is objectively a completely ludicrous quote,' he wrote), while simultaneously defending it as 'plausible' ('we reasonably suspect Trump was thinking it') and illustrative of a point he wished to make about 'the state of the media and the twitterverse today.' In other words, Bremmer was parodying Trump; his intent was satirical. As we have had all too many occasions to point out on this site, however, satire can be a double-edged sword on social media, because some people have trouble recognizing satire as such. Bremmer was blasted by critics on all sides for not being clearer about his intent from the beginning. 'It's like he wants to give Trump ammo for the 'fake news' nonsense,' wrote historian Kevin Kruse. He called on Bremmer to delete the tweet. Bremmer did remove the tweet, eventually, and issued a clarification and apology: My tweet yesterday about Trump preferring Kim Jong Un to Biden as President was meant in jest. The President correctly quoted me as saying it was a 'completely ludicrous' statement. I should have been clearer. My apologies. - ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) May 27, 2019 Whereupon Trump, as predicted, pounced on the opportunity to denounce Bremmer's original tweet as 'fake news' and implied that it rose to the level of 'libel': .@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP 'a completely ludicrous quote,' attributing it to me.

We note further that while Bremmer backed down in the face of criticism, Trump did not, electing instead to double down on the insult by making light of it in his final tweet on the subject: I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil.

Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, announced a proposal he said 'would end the practice of Texas schools hiring full-time teachers with no classroom teaching experience.' 'Parents are shocked when I tell them that their children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching but is now responsible for educating a classroom full of kids,' Villarreal said in a Nov. 30 press release. 'If we are serious about improving education, we need to listen to the research about the importance of student teaching. We shouldn't hand the classroom over to a teacher who has never stood in front of a class and taught a lesson.' Any questions? We decided to check how much practical experience is required of newly-minted Texas schoolteachers. On its website, the State Board for Educator Certification lists the basic requirements for becoming a Texas teacher: a bachelor's degree, teacher training through an approved program (universities and 'other entities' such as for-profit programs) and completion of state teacher certification tests. Texas has 177 teacher preparation programs, run by providers including universities, school districts and for-profit companies, according to a November 2009 Houston Chronicle news story. Traditional university programs include a student-teaching component prior to graduation. For aspiring teachers who already have a college degree, SBEC suggests 'alternative certification and post-baccalaureate programs.' According to the website, 'many of these programs can be completed in a year, during which time you may have a paid teaching position in a public school classroom.' According to the Texas Education Agency, 7,500 new teachers during the 2010 academic school year were certified through university programs, and 11,567 were certified via alternative programs. Asked to back up Villarreal's statement, Peter Clark, his legislative director, pointed to those teachers who are in alternative programs. 'They do not receive their full certification until the end of that first year teaching,' he said in an e-mail. 'But during that full school year they are the teacher of record responsible for a classroom, and they may have started that year without ever standing in front of a classroom of students and delivering a lesson plan.' According to state law, teacher candidates who serve a year-long internship have a 'probationary certificate' until they complete the year, but during that time they're classified as a 'teacher' on school campuses. Does that mean they haven't had any teaching practice before entering the classroom? Karen Loonam, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that it 'is possible' for someone to start teaching without any practice teaching 'but highly unlikely since our rules require 30 clock-hours of field experience in the classroom and 80 hours of training prior to entering the classroom.' According to state law, 15 of those 30 hours of field experience must be spent performing 'professional educator activities' while interacting with students, teachers and faculty in a school setting 'that is part of regular classroom instruction.' According to Villarreal's press release, his legislation 'would require a teacher candidate to undertake 15 hours of practice teaching to become full-time teachers... this legislation would ensure that the 15 hours on campus are spent delivering lesson plans rather than merely observing, assisting with administrative functions or attending school events.' In an interview, Janice Lopez, the education agency's director of educator standards, told us the law doesn't require that those 15 hours in the classroom are spent teaching. 'We require that they go through training and hopefully that training is interactive - interacting with students while observing a certified teacher,' Lopez said. Loonam told us that usually the field experience is 'a combination of activities for an individual to see the realities of the complex job of teaching - how does the teacher develop lesson plans... observing students... classroom management. We've tried to put in our rules some requirements to help these people get prepared before entering the classroom,' she said. Loonam also told us that school districts' 'late hires' may start teaching in the classroom without having those 15 classroom hours. 'If a principal finds out on a Thursday - and school's going to start Monday - that she just lost a teacher for whatever reason, she needs to find someone to fill that vacancy,' she said. If there's a teacher shortage in that particular district, the district may hire a prospective teacher who knows about the subject to be taught but doesn't have the required training. The new teacher is then assigned a certified teacher as a mentor and completes training throughout the school year. Ed Fuller, a researcher for the University Council for Educational Administration, an interstate consortium of higher-ed institutions, called the Texas education code's practice-teaching requirement 'vague.' 'Teachers are not, in fact, required to complete any practice teaching or student teaching before becoming a teacher of record' - a teacher who has sole responsibility for a class, he said. Fuller said teachers without any experience come largely from alternative certification programs that don't offer student-teaching training. But according to Vernon Reaser, who heads an alternative teacher-certification program based in Houston, the alternate route is more demanding than the single semester of student-teaching required by university programs. Alternate-route teacher candidates must first complete a year of professional teaching - the internship - as a real teacher before the principal decides whether the teacher should be certified, said Reaser, president of A+ Texas Teachers. He told us most prospective teachers who are certified through the program do practice teach, 'and those that don't will get it anyway in the first few months. 'This is the person's career, not just a temporary assignment like student teaching is,' he said. 'They have to perform well that year just like every other teacher does in order to keep their job.' We also consulted Pamela Hall, a personnel administrator for the Austin Independent School District, who told us the district rarely hires individuals without teaching experience, but when it does, it's through the state's alternate certification programs. Such teachers are on probation for their first year, she said. Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, told us the agency does not keep information on how many individuals never taught before becoming classroom teachers. She said that information is kept by each certification program. Time to grade Villarreal's statement. We did not find a precise count of teachers in Austin or Texas public schools who started without teaching practice, though, significantly, it's undisputed that schools can - and do - hire teachers lacking even a minute of experience teaching a class. We rate the statement True.

Karen Loonam, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that it 'is possible' for someone to start teaching without any practice teaching 'but highly unlikely since our rules require 30 clock-hours of field experience in the classroom and 80 hours of training prior to entering the classroom.' According to state law, 15 of those 30 hours of field experience must be spent performing 'professional educator activities' while interacting with students, teachers and faculty in a school setting 'that is part of regular classroom instruction.' According to Villarreal's press release, his legislation 'would require a teacher candidate to undertake 15 hours of practice teaching to become full-time teachers... this legislation would ensure that the 15 hours on campus are spent delivering lesson plans rather than merely observing, assisting with administrative functions or attending school events.' In an interview, Janice Lopez, the education agency's director of educator standards, told us the law doesn't require that those 15 hours in the classroom are spent teaching. 'We require that they go through training and hopefully that training is interactive - interacting with students while observing a certified teacher,' Lopez said. Loonam told us that usually the field experience is 'a combination of activities for an individual to see the realities of the complex job of teaching - how does the teacher develop lesson plans... observing students... classroom management. We've tried to put in our rules some requirements to help these people get prepared before entering the classroom,' she said. Loonam also told us that school districts' 'late hires' may start teaching in the classroom without having those 15 classroom hours. 'If a principal finds out on a Thursday - and school's going to start Monday - that she just lost a teacher for whatever reason, she needs to find someone to fill that vacancy,' she said. If there's a teacher shortage in that particular district, the district may hire a prospective teacher who knows about the subject to be taught but doesn't have the required training. The new teacher is then assigned a certified teacher as a mentor and completes training throughout the school year. Ed Fuller, a researcher for the University Council for Educational Administration, an interstate consortium of higher-ed institutions, called the Texas education code's practice-teaching requirement 'vague.' 'Teachers are not, in fact, required to complete any practice teaching or student teaching before becoming a teacher of record' - a teacher who has sole responsibility for a class, he said. Fuller said teachers without any experience come largely from alternative certification programs that don't offer student-teaching training. But according to Vernon Reaser, who heads an alternative teacher-certification program based in Houston, the alternate route is more demanding than the single semester of student-teaching required by university programs. Alternate-route teacher candidates must first complete a year of professional teaching - the internship - as a real teacher before the principal decides whether the teacher should be certified, said Reaser, president of A+ Texas Teachers. He told us most prospective teachers who are certified through the program do practice teach, 'and those that don't will get it anyway in the first few months. 'This is the person's career, not just a temporary assignment like student teaching is,' he said. 'They have to perform well that year just like every other teacher does in order to keep their job.' We also consulted Pamela Hall, a personnel administrator for the Austin Independent School District, who told us the district rarely hires individuals without teaching experience, but when it does, it's through the state's alternate certification programs. Such teachers are on probation for their first year, she said. Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, told us the agency does not keep information on how many individuals never taught before becoming classroom teachers. She said that information is kept by each certification program. Time to grade Villarreal's statement. We did not find a precise count of teachers in Austin or Texas public schools who started without teaching practice, though, significantly, it's undisputed that schools can - and do - hire teachers lacking even a minute of experience teaching a class.

This is accurate, so we rate it True.","Fox News' chief political anchor said President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was remarkable for what it left out. 'The words 'al-Qaida' were never used,' said host Bret Baier, 'the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001.' The omission was particularly notable because of the speech's proximity to the Charlie Hebdo attacks tied to al-Qaida jihadists in the Arabian Peninsula and heightened warnings from British authorities about a possible attack from 'core' al-Qaida, Baier said. Instead, as Baier noted, Obama talked about ISIS and asked Congress to officially authorize a military fight against Islamic State terrorists, which broke off from al-Qaida. Still, Baier's point about al-Qaida not being in the address is right. Every State of the Union address since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by al-Qaida have included references to this specific jihadist movement. We checked copies of speeches by President George W. Bush and Obama from the American Presidency Project of the University of California Santa Barbara. The Bush speeches As Baier said, the last time we didn't hear 'al-Qaida' in a State of the Union-like setting was Bush's Feb. 27, 2001, 'budget message' to a joint session of Congress. (Obama's first speech to Congress in 2009 was also not technically a State of the Union, though it was covered and delivered like one.) In Bush's 2001 speech, delivered nearly seven months before the day that changed everything, Bush did allude to 'terrorists who threaten with bombs' as one of the widespread threats of the new 21st century. But he did not mention al-Qaida by name. Bush's speech in 2002 was heavily centered on the new war on terrorism in Afghanistan, not surprisingly, but only mentioned al-Qaida once in reference to flight attendants who spotted a man trained by the group and wearing explosives and foiled his attack before Christmas. The group's name resurged in 2003 as Bush described advances in capturing its leaders and made the case to go after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for his pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and because he 'aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida.' Subsequent speeches by Bush mainly mentioned al-Qaida in connection with captured leaders or defending the need for the PATRIOT Act's surveillance programs. Bush's last two State of the Unions talked about al-Qaida way more often as the country grew more weary of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was reminding Americans why they were there. There were 10 mentions in 2007 and 11 mentions in 2008, including this excerpt: When we met last year, al-Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is al-Qaida that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al-Qaida leaders and operatives. Last month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al-Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al-Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. The Obama speeches Obama took office criticizing Bush's handling of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, so it's no surprise that his early mentions of al-Qaida come in a different context. 'And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al-Qaida and combat extremism,' Obama told a joint session to Congress, 'because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it.' This was the same speech -- again, technically not a State of the Union -- in which Obama called for the closure of the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (which is still open). Three years later, Obama reminded the country about the killing of Osama bin Laden and top al-Qaida fighters in his 2012 State of the Union. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al-Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. Obama's 2013 and 2014 remarks discussed the demise of core al-Qaida, calling the group that organized the 9/11 attacks a 'shadow of its former self.' But 'core' was the key distinction, as Obama also highlighted the rise of affiliate extremist groups not long after the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And as for last night's speech (see our annotation)? No direct mention of al-Qaida, but Obama did reference terrorists. First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue ... to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. ... And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission bypassing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.",,,,"In President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, 'the words 'al-Qaida' were never used, the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001.",supported,true,,politifact

It attributes its information to the Guttmacher Institute. According to Guttmacher, there were 27,110 abortions in Virginia in 2011, and 17,210 in 2017. That's a huge 37 percent decrease - double the national average. But it wasn't the largest drop among states. It ranked fourth. So we rate the Family Foundation's statement Mostly True.","The Family Foundation, an influential voice for socially-conservative policies, recently predicted that an era of declining abortions in Virginia will be halted by new Democratic majorities in the General Assembly. 'Frankly, an uptick is unavoidable,' the group said in a blog posted July 9 - shortly after laws went into effect repealing major abortion restrictions Republicans won in 2011 and 2012. The Foundation wrote, 'It wasn't long ago (September 2019) that the Guttmacher Institute - a left-wing organization that advocates abortion- released a nationwide report revealing that Virginia, more than any other state, had the steepest drop in the number of abortions between 2011 and 2017.' Although Guttmacher Institute in New York is pro-abortion rights, it's statistical research has been widely reported and cited as authoritative by activists on both sides of the abortion debate. We wondered whether Guttmacher indeed found that Virginia had the biggest drop in abortion between 2011 and 2017. Guttmacher periodically publishes reports on the number of abortions performed in each state. The Foundation's blog refers to Guttmacher's latest report on states, released last September, that has data from 2014 to 2017. We accessed an earlier Guttmacher report to get statistics from 2011. The reports show the number of Virginia abortions from 2011 through 2017 fell from 27,110 to 17,210. That's a 37% drop - twice the 18.5% national decline. But contrary to the Family Foundation, Virginia wasn't No. 1 in reducing abortions. Delaware led the way with a 63% decrease, followed by Hawaii and West Virginia. In raw numbers, Virginia saw a 9,900 drop in abortions during the span. That was fifth highest, trailing the large states of California, New York, Texas and Florida. Guttmacher also compiles each state's abortion rate - the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Virgina had 16.3 abortions per 1,000 women in 2011, and dropped to 9.5 per thousand in 2017. That's a 42 percent decrease and it ranked third, behind Delaware and Hawaii. Although Guttmacher found that 32 states toughened their abortion laws bewteen 2011 and 2017, it questions whether those restrictions were the main force behind the national drop in abortions. Guttmacher says other factors may be more important, such as fewer pregnancies and greater access to contraception. The Family Foundation, however, says the restrictions were the 'major factor' in Virginia's drop. It points to laws passed early last decade when Republican Bob McDonnell was governor, the GOP held two-thirds of the seats in the House, and the Senate had an anti-abortion majority of Republicans and a couple of Democrats. In 2011, Virginia enacted a law requiring abortion clinics to comply with hospital building codes - forcing centers to make expensive renovations or close. The number of Virginia clinics over the next six years dropped from 21 to 15. In 2012, a new law required women to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion and be offered a look at the image of the fetus. The law required many women to visit a clinic twice to get an abortion - some making lengthy trips. In November 2019, Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate for the first time in 24 years. Working with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, they repealed both abortion restrictions.",,,,"'...Virginia, more than any other state, had the steepest drop in the number of abortions between 2011 and 2017.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The U.S. representative from Texas partnered with Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, and the two first introduced it in 2016. That version was presented as an alternative to Obamacare, which Sessions had told The Atlantic was a 'compromise': 'If you want to stay there, you can,' Sessions told me, referring to the millions of Americans who now have insurance through the state or federal exchanges established under the ACA. Or, to borrow a now-discredited line from Democrats: If you like your Obamacare, you can keep it. Meanwhile, lawmakers and various organizations with a stake in healthcare are fighting it out over the bill backed by President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan: Doctors and other providers said the bill would probably cause many patients to lose insurance and raise healthcare costs. In a letter to key lawmakers, the American Medical Association urged them to reconsider its drastic changes to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor. The AMA, which supported Obamacare, said that by replacing income-based subsidies with age-based tax credits to help people buy insurance, the plan would make coverage more expensive, if not out of reach, for poor and sick Americans. Obamacare enabled 20 million previously uninsured people obtain medical coverage. The AARP lobbying group for older Americans also opposed the Republican plan. Seeking to mollify conservatives who on Tuesday blasted the bill as too similar to the Obamacare law it is supposed to supplant, House Speaker Paul Ryan touted it as 'a conservative wish list' and 'monumental, exciting conservative reform.' While a bill entitled 'World's Greatest Healthcare Plan' was introduced to the 115th Congress by U.S. Rep. Sessions, it is not the one backed by the president and the majority of Republicans.","Is the GOP's Obamacare Replacement Called 'World's Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017'?

How would he respond if such a group formed? 'Nothing I or anyone else can do -- I think that is the point, isn't it?,' he wrote. We rate Sadler's claim True.","At a candidate forum in Austin, Paul Sadler was asked if he'd support a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 Supreme Court decision that touched off a flood of super PACs, a type of political action committee that cannot coordinate with a candidate's campaign, but can independently spend unlimited donations to influence a race. 'Hell yes, I will,' Sadler said at the March 1, 2012, Travis County Democratic Party event. Calling the super PACs' impact 'scandalous,' the lawyer and former Texas House member said: 'In our race on the Republican side, already, there are four super PACs -- four super PACs -- and it is a distortion of our democracy.' Such PACs are weighing in heavily this election season, raising eyebrows in some cases because they can accept money from certain tax-exempt groups that don't have to disclose their donors' names. According to the nonpartisan research group Center for Reponsive Politics' opensecrets.org, super PACs have spent $65 million in the 2012 cycle so far supporting presidential candidates -- including President Barack Obama, who as PolitiFact noted February 7, 2012, executed a Full Flop in his stance on fundraising for super PACs. But four in our little ol' U.S. Senate race? Jeff Rotkoff, spokesman for Sadler's campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told us the backup for his candidate's statement was included in Sadler's February 8, 2012, fundraising email, which cited in turn a Texas Tribune news story from the day before. That story listed four super PACs and linked them to candidates: Texas Conservatives Fund and Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee, supporting Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Real Street Conservatives, supporting Craig James; and Club for Growth Action PAC, supporting Ted Cruz. Like traditional PACs, super PACs register with the Federal Election Commission, which describes supers as 'independent expenditure-only committees.' Typically when a super PAC is created, the organizers attach a memo to the FEC stating their intent to make independent expenditures. The FEC website displays those memos for three of the PACs that Sadler referred to. For the fourth, we asked Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller to confirm its super PAC status. Keller told us by email that the club's Action PAC is its super PAC, distinct from its traditional Club for Growth PAC, which Keller said has endorsed Ted Cruz. So, yep: All four are supers. We set out to learn what we could about their activities. From websites and what the four PACs had reported to the FEC through March 6, 2012, we gleaned these thumbnails, keeping in mind that only the Club for Growth super PAC has existed long enough to have filed reports of contributions and expenditures: Texas Conservatives Fund: Created in January 2012 by Paul Kilgore, according to its statement of organization filed with the FEC. Kilgore, whom we reached by phone, is president of a campaign consulting firm in Athens, Ga. The PAC says on its website that its mission is to help Dewhurst get the GOP nomination and be elected to the U.S. Senate. Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee: Created in January 2012 by Larry Hicks, according to its statement of organization. A February 3, 2012, Houston Chronicle blog entry reported that the Conservative Renewal PAC would support Dewhurst. Hicks, whom we reached by phone, is a certified public accountant in Houston. Real Street Conservatives PAC: Created in February 2012 by Jerad Najvar, according to its statement of organization. Najvar, an election lawyer in Houston, told us by phone that he wasn't authorized to state the PAC's purpose or name the client who hired him to file the organizing documents. The Austin American-Statesman reported in a February 3, 2012, news blog post that a source had confirmed the Real Street Conservatives PAC supports James.

8788,13820,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lawn-darts-sales-ban/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 2 October 2017, criticism appeared on social media about a lack of federal action on gun safety which invoked the U.S. government's response concerning the sale of lawn darts toys following a single child's death in 1987: 'Just your reminder that after a girl was killed playing with lawn darts in 1987, the U.S. government banned them. Lawn darts.' The sale of lawn darts in the U.S. had been banned for many years before the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reached a compromise with manufacturers in 1976 that allowed the darts to be sold under certain conditions: they could not be sold in toy stores, retailers could not place them in or near their toy departments, and the darts (which were typically sold in sets of four) had to include a clear warning that they should only be used by adults. The issue was forced back into the national spotlight through a campaign by David Snow, whose 7-year-old daughter, Michelle, died at her California home in April 1987 after a lawn dart penetrated her skull. At least one researcher estimated that the steel-tipped dart hit the girl with a force of 23,000 pounds per square inch. In 1988, Snow criticized the federal guidelines that allowed the sale of lawn darts, saying that 'We're talking a three-foot high box with a little tiny warning. I mean, there's something in that box that can be fatal. That's what my anger is - because I know what happened, I didn't see the warning and my child is now dead. Because if I had seen that warning, I would have never brought this product home.' Snow went on to contact several federal legislators and testify before a House subcommittee regarding the dangers that lawn darts carried, and his campaign spurred the CPSC to reinstitute a ban on the sale of lawn dart kits in May 1988. The CPSC said at the time of the decision that: Three children - ages 4, 7, and 13 - are known to have died in lawn dart-related incidents. An estimated 670 lawn dart injuries are treated each year in U.S. hospital emergency rooms. Three quarters of the injured are under 15 years old. The types of lawn darts associated with the three deaths will be banned by the CPSC action. In October 1988, two months before the ban would take effect, Snow declared that 'My year-and-a-half struggle is now over. I made seven trips to Washington. I got blisters on my feet. But I just kept at it and today is the payoff. At least now I can say I kept my promise to my little girl.' Bob Archer, one of the owners of Kent Sporting Goods, a U.S.-based supplier of lawn darts, questioned the CPSC's ruling, saying: 'I think things are wrong with guns. Which is the greater evil - lawn darts that kill three people or guns that kill ... thousands in a year?' Canada instituted a similar ban on sales and importation of lawn darts in June 1989. Despite the bans, some companies have reportedly worked around it by selling the dart's two parts (the metal tips and the plastic fins) separately.",Did the U.S. Ban Lawn Dart Sales After One Child's Death?

This message is spam and is in no way affiliated with Dell Children's Medical Center or the Seton Family of Hospitals. If you receive this message, please delete it. As demonstrated so aptly by public efforts to provide relief to earthquake victims in Haiti, beneficences initiated by cell phone generally involve a tracking and billing mechanism that requires participants to text a specific short word or phrase to a particular (five-digit) number, not the willy-nilly forwarding of a explanatory narrative to as many people as possible. In 2009 we began to note that 'Forward this message to help fund medical care for a sick or dying child' appeals were beginning to appear as cell phone text messages as well as being passed in e-mail. That trend continues into the present, with the 'shot 14-year-old boy' just another iteration of the same basic hoax that falsely claims the American Cancer Society, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, or some other large entity will donate a predetermined amount of money every time a particular message is forwarded. Such leg-pulls have been circulating via e-mail since 1997. Typically, a large charity is named as the benefactor standing ready to direct monies towards the costs of medical care for the languishing child, but various corporations have also been fingered for this role in other iterations of the hoax, such as AOL and ZDNet in the Rachel Arlington leg pull (brain cancer sufferer in need of an operation) and McDonald's and Pizza Hut in the Justin Mallory prank (epileptic in need of long-term care). Everyone wants to help sick children get better, and the thought of a little boy or girl suffering from some dread disease or infirmity because people couldn't be bothered to forward a message tugs straight at the heartstrings. Problem is, hoaxsters know that, and they play upon these very human drives for their personal amusement. Once again, that is the case here: Well-intentioned forwarding does nothing towards helping a sick child; it does, however, make the day of some prankster.

Manchin is close on the number of federal workers in the state. However, it's important to note that not all of those federal workers in West Virginia were either furloughed or required to work without pay; those employed by agencies with valid spending bills were working and getting paid as normal. We rate the statement Mostly True.","As the partial government shutdown was underway in January, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., tweeted about his distaste for the closure. In the tweet sent on Jan. 2, 2019, Manchin wrote, 'I have always said we should never shutdown the government and governing this way is embarrassing for both Democrats and Republicans. This partial government shutdown effects every American, including the 18,000 federal employees in West Virginia.' The tweet linked to a more detailed statement by the senator that listed some of the federal agencies that have workers in West Virginia. I have always said we should never shutdown the government and governing this way is embarrassing for both Democrats and Republicans. This partial government shutdown effects every American, including the 18,000 federal employees in West Virginia. MORE: https://t.co/BKrpwdWJa9- Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) January 2, 2019 We decided to take a closer look at whether Manchin was right that the partial government shutdown affected '18,000 federal employees in West Virginia.' How many federal workers in West Virginia? How many federal workers are there in West Virginia? It turns out that Manchin's number is in the ballpark. Data from the Office of Personnel Management -- the federal government's human resources department -- shows that as of September 2017, West Virginia had a total of 18,656 federal workers. What happened during the shutdown? Determining the accuracy of Manchin's tweet requires a look at some background on the shutdown. The shutdown stemmed largely from disagreement between President Donald Trump and the Democratic-controlled House over whether to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and, if so, how much money should be allocated for it. It was a partial rather than a full shutdown because only some federal agencies had to close because their funding bills expired. The departments affected by the partial shutdown due to their funding bills expiring were Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, parts of Interior (such as the Bureau of Reclamation), State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Treasury and NASA. A range of independent agencies were also shuttered, including the U.S. Trade Representative, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Archives and Records Administration, and the Smithsonian Institution. At the same time, other departments had valid spending bills in place, so they operated as normal. They included Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, Veterans Affairs and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The shuttered federal departments and agencies employed more than 800,000 people, or roughly 40 percent of the federal workforce. These 800,000 employees fell into two categories. About 380,000 were furloughed, meaning they could come to work and were not being paid. Another 420,000 weren't being paid, but were required to remain on the job. This distinction is relevant for analyzing the text of Manchin's tweet, because it means that 60 percent of federal workers whose agencies were running as normal were on the job and were paid on time. This means that not every West Virginia federal worker was directly affected by the shutdown, either by being furloughed or by being required to work without being paid. The workers who remained on the job and received their paychecks may have been affected by the shutdown by virtue of being ordinary Americans who lacked access to certain shuttered federal services. But they were not specifically affected because of their own federal job. And Manchin was correct in his detailed statement when he cited a range of departments and agencies that were left without valid funding bills. They included the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service, the Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons, and the National Science Foundation's Green Bank Observatory.",,,,"The partial government shutdown in early 2019 affected '18,000 federal employees in West Virginia.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Unfortunately, according to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald, the state tops another list - one with a particularly dubious ranking. New Jersey has 'the highest property taxes in the nation and not by a little,' Greenwald (D-Camden) said in an April 1 interview with Michael Aron on NJTV's 'On The Record.' 'They are the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average.' New Jersey having high property taxes isn't new. But are they more than double the national average? Greenwald's statement is largely on the money, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Let's first explain the source of Greenwald's data and how tax rankings are reviewed. Greenwald got his data from a 2009 list compiled by the business-backed Tax Foundation in Washington, DC. The 2009 data shows that New Jersey ranked number one in three key tax metrics: median property taxes paid on homes; taxes as a percentage of home value; and taxes as a percentage of income. Nick Kasprak, a Tax Foundation analyst and programmer, said taxes as a percentage of home value is 'the most relevant statistic' of the three because it can apply to most people, ranging from those who own condominiums to those in McMansions. 'It's a good way of comparing apples to apples across the states,' Kasprak said of the metric, adding that the Tax Foundation's numbers are estimates and come from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. So how long has New Jersey worn the highest property taxes banner? That depends on the metric. We found that New Jersey property taxes have topped the rest of the nation's at least back to 2004 when looking at median property taxes paid on homes and taxes paid as a percentage of income. When looking at all three Tax Foundation metrics for years 2004 through 2009, New Jersey's median property taxes paid on homes was more than triple the national average; more than double the national average for taxes paid as a percentage of income; and at least one and-a-half times the national average for taxes paid as a percentage of home value. Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University, said comparing states by property taxes alone is disingenuous because states fund certain needs differently. For example, some states use property taxes to fund education, others do not. 'In reality, we need to look in total at the entire tax burden,' Harrison said. 'The implication is that New Jerseyans pay the highest taxes in the country, right? That's what people think. What I'm saying is that New Jersey pays a very high tax burden. What we need to do is look at the total tax burden: gas tax, sales tax, security, user fees, certainly property taxes and sales taxes as well.' Jon Bramnick, leader of the Assembly Republicans, agreed property taxes are high but credited a slowing of their growth to Gov. Chris Christie's implementation of a 2-percent property tax cap, changing arbitration procedures for police and firefighters, and other measures. 'We obviously have to have mergers, shared services and consolidations across New Jersey,' Bramnick said, adding that a bipartisan effort is key. 'These are the factors that you have to have to continue down that road. If you do, you will see a slowing of property taxes.' Our ruling Greenwald said in a TV interview that New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average.

He sips a cup of hot chocolate and scans the crowd, occasionally cocking his head to listen to the airport announcements. He peruses a book, Hillary Rodham Clinton's 'It Takes a Village.' But Mehran Karimi Nasseri is going nowhere. He has been waiting for a flight out of France, he says, for 10 years. Nasseri was expelled from Iran a decade ago for his political views. Through a series of fateful missteps, he landed here without any documents. Since then, Europe's increasingly stiff stance toward refugees and his fragile mental state have kept him at the airport here in legal limbo. His is a story of broken hopes and bureaucracy, of a trip across Europe in search of a homeland that became a journey into mental chaos and despair. And it is a story of a man who has searched for his family, only to find an adopted one here, at Charles de Gaulle. 'He's like a part of the airport. Everyone knows him,' says Muhamed Mourrid, the manager of the Bye Bye Bar, pointing to the spot where Nasseri, 47, has lived for a decade. 'That's his table, his chair, his place.' Adds Marise Petry, a Lufthansa clerk, 'He's one of us. We even get letters for him.' Among the annals of horrific refugee tales, Nasseri's story is remarkable for its pathos and complexity. It begins in Iran in 1977, when Nasseri, fresh from studying in England, was expelled for protesting against the shah. His expulsion left him without a passport. Nasseri came to Europe. He bounced from capital to capital, applying for refugee status and being refused, again and again, for nearly four years. In 1981, his request for political asylum from Iran was finally granted by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Belgium. That decision gave him refugee credentials, which in turn allowed him to seek citizenship in a European country. The son of an Iranian and a Briton, Nasseri decided in 1986 on England with the hope of finding relatives there. He got as far as Paris, where in 1988 his briefcase containing his refugee documents was stolen in a train station. Nasseri boarded a plane for London anyway. But when officials at Heathrow Airport found he had no passport, they sent him back to Charles de Gaulle. At first, the French police arrested him for illegal entry. But as Nasseri had no documents, there was no country of origin to which he could be deported. So he took up residence in Terminal One. From its circular confines, he and his attorney, the Paris-based human rights lawyer Christian Bourget, battled to define his status and send him to London. In 1992, a French court finally ruled that Nasseri had entered the airport legally as a refugee and could not be expelled from it. But the court could not force the French government to allow him out of the airport onto French soil. In fact, Bourget said, French authorities refused to give Nasseri either a refugee or transit visa. 'It was pure bureaucracy,' said the lawyer. French immigration authorities have no comment on the case. Bourget and Nasseri then focused on Belgium, where they hoped to reclaim Nasseri's original refugee documents. But Belgian refugee officials refused to mail them to him in France. They argued that Nasseri had to present himself in person so that they could be sure he was the same man to whom they had granted political asylum years before. But, inexplicably, the Belgian government refused at that point to allow Nasseri to return there. And under Belgian law, a refugee who voluntarily leaves a country that has accepted him cannot return. In 1995, the Belgian government finally told Nasseri that he could retrieve his refugee documents if he agreed to live in Belgium under the supervision of a social worker. Nasseri refused. He said he would move only to Great Britain. And so here he has remained, year after year. At first glance, the dignified man does not appear to be a refugee who sleeps on an airport bench because he has nowhere else to go. His clothes are clean, his moustache well-trimmed. He keeps his one blazer covered with plastic wrap, hanging from an airport cart. His belongings are carefully packed in a frayed suitcase and a stack of Lufthansa boxes. Nasseri nods hello to a clerk, who calls him 'Alfred,' his nickname here. He follows the news closely, thanks to the most recent Time magazine, which the postman has just dropped off. And he loves to discuss the new selections from the Book-of-the-Month Club. 'I just keep on reading, every day,' said the soft-spoken Nasseri, a courtly gentleman who rises and offers his seat to a visitor. 'I just keep waiting here.' His pallid complexion is testament to his inability to cross the airport threshold to the outside world. He walks to the doors of Terminal One and absorbs fresh air as they swing open. But he never steps outside. His hollow cheeks and thin frame show the limits of the generosity of airport staff and strangers to help with his meals. Nasseri's confused account of his plight speaks to the psychological price he has paid in his fight to become a man who belongs somewhere. 'Nobody could suffer all he did and stay normal,' noted Bourget. The sad truth is this: After fighting for years to leave the airport and apply for citizenship elsewhere, Nasseri was afraid to do so when the opportunity arose. Belgium offered Nasseri the chance to settle there, but he refused. 'Now, I think he will stay in the airport until he dies,' Bourget concluded softly. His bizarre tale has brought him a degree of fame. He has been the subject of news reports from Finland to Britain. His life story became a 1994 French film, starring Jean Rochefort. Nasseri gets fewer visitors now to punctuate the long days down on Terminal One's boutique level, ringed with stores and small cafes. But he still has a following who help clothe and feed him and lift his spirits. 'He does no harm to anyone,' said Papa Starr, manager of the Les Palmes restaurant. 'Everyone cares for him here.' Several times a week, the airport priest stops by to visit him, as does Dr. Phillipe Bargain, the airport doctor. Many staff regularly visit him at his table for a cup of coffee and a chat. 'I get lots of cards at Christmas,' he said. 'I call it my American Christmas.' His life follows the quotidian airport cycle. He wakes at 5:30 in order to shave in the men's room before passengers arrive. He reads all day long. At night, he waits until the airport stores are locked before he brushes his teeth with the toothbrush and toothpaste from a complimentary airline travel kit. Weekly, he rinses out his clothes overnight in the bathroom. Nasseri is renowned throughout the airport for his refusal to ask for help. 'We have a colleague who gave him clothes, but he returned them, saying 'I'm not a beggar,'' said Crystelle L'Hospitalier, a Lufthansa clerk. But he has to eat, and accepts occasional meal vouchers and francs from stewardesses and airport staff. As the years have slipped by, it has become increasingly clear that Nasseri will never leave Charles de Gaulle. His airport years have made him 'crazier by the day,' on the topic of his future, said airport doctor Bargain. When he talks about flying to London, the staff here greet him with understanding smiles. 'An airport is kind of a place between heaven and earth,' said Danielle Yzerman, spokeswoman for Charles de Gaulle. 'He has found a home here.'1Nasseri, who has since adopted the name 'Sir, Alfred Mehran' (that's not a typo - Nasseri took both the title and its misplaced comma from a mistake in a letter from British immigration), has changed the story he tells about his background several times over the years:Over the years, he has claimed many things about his origins. At one time his mother was Swedish, another time English. Nasseri's effectively reinvented himself in the Charles de Gaulle airport and denies these days that he's Iranian, deflecting any conversation about his childhood in Tehran. ('He pretends he doesn't speak Persian,' his longtime lawyer, Christian Bourguet, says. 'He was interviewed by Iranian journalists and made believe he didn't understand.') When we first met two years ago, he insisted that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was attempting to locate his parents in order to establish his identity. But a spokeswoman for the agency dismissed the assertion as 'pure folly.' Early on in his saga, Nasseri maintained that he was expelled from his homeland for antigovernment activity in 1977. According to a number of reports, Nasseri protested against the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi while a student in England, and when he returned to Iran, found himself imprisoned, and shortly thereafter exiled. He bounced around Europe for a few years with temporary refugee papers, alighting finally in Belgium, where he was awarded official refugee status in 1981. He traveled to Britain and France without difficulty until 1988, when he landed at Charles de Gaulle airport after being denied entry into Britain, because, he contends, his passport and refugee certificate were stolen in a mugging on a Paris subway. Nasseri could not prove who he was, nor offer proof of his refugee status. So he moved into the Zone d'attente, a holding area for travelers without papers. He stayed for days, then weeks - then months, then years. As his bizarre odyssey stretched on, Bourguet, the noted French human rights lawyer, took on the case, and the news media piled on. Articles appeared around the world, and Nasseri became the subject of three documentary films. (Oddly, apparently none of his friends or relatives have attempted to contact him.)2Nasseriis known for his honesty (when he isn't talking about himself) and his refusal of charity. On two occasions he turned in billfolds full of money that had been mislaid by passengers. Airline and airport personnel push meal vouchers on him so he can eat. 'French fries are my favorite,' he confides. 'It's not a very healthy diet, but I get enough.'On 17 September 1999, an international travel card and a French residency permit were put into Nasseri's hands. With them, he's now free to leave the airport, either to take up residency in France or to fly to another country that will allow him entry. He refuses to sign them, however, because they list his nationality as Iranian, and he wants it listed as British. He remains at Charles de Gaulle airport, using the excuse that he's determined to stick to this point rather than face life outside the terminal:[In 1999] he finally got permission to leave the airport - in fact, he can now go wherever he likes in Europe. The problem is, he no longer wants to. 'He is scared to leave this bubble world he has been living in,' said Dr. Philippe Bargain, the airport's medical director. 'Finally getting the papers has been a huge shock to him, as if he was just thrown from his horse. When you wait 11 years for something and suddenly in a few minutes you sign some papers and it's done - imagine what a shock that is.' 'He will have to be weaned from the airport, like an addict really.' Dr. Bargain said. 'Still, it does make you wonder what kind of a society we live in that this can happen to a man.'3In July 2006, Nasseri was hospitalized. In January 2007 he left the hospital and was looked after by the airport's branch of the French Red Cross; he was lodged for a few weeks in a hotel close to the airport. On 6 March 2007, he transferred to a homeless shelter in Paris.Barbara 'terminal boredom' MikkelsonSightings: The 2004 Tom Hanks film The Terminal is loosely based upon the experiences of Mehran Karimi Nasseri.",Man Living at Paris Airport,Has a man has been living at a Paris airport since 1988?,,"Between 1988 and 2006, a man lived at a Paris airport.",supported,True.,"<p>Over the years, he has claimed many things about his origins.

The Greenbook, which is compiled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, provides 'a complete historical record of United States' (U.S.) foreign aid to the rest of the world by reporting all loans and grants authorized by the U.S. Government for each fiscal year,' according to its site. We obtained aid data by country, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 U.S. dollars, from 1982 to 2009. This time, Israel ($117.6 billion) was number one, followed by Egypt ($83.7 billion) at number two. Rounding out the top 10 were Iraq ($54.4 billion), Afghanistan ($35.2 billion), Russia ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($18 billion), Turkey ($16.7 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), Sudan ($10.3 billion), and Colombia ($10.3 billion). For our ruling, we wanted to know if Douthat was correct that under Mubarak's rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. Douthat is right. We rate his statement True.","Hosni Mubarak may have ruled Egypt with an iron fist since 1981, but he's been an important ally for the United States in the fight against terrorism -- or so the thinking goes. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, though, questioned whether Mubarak has been as helpful as some believe. Mubarak, after all, led a regime that tortured political dissidents. 'By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country's Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri - Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda - out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad,' Douthat wrote. Douthat credited the book The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright, for documenting that history. 'At the same time, Mubarak's relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview,' Douthat wrote. 'Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it's been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States.' Douthat concluded his column by noting that a different government in Egypt might not necessarily be a good thing. 'The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door,' he wrote. We were interested in Douthat's statement about aid to Egypt. He is correct based on the most recent statistics. If you don't count Afghanistan ($8.9 billion) and Iraq ($7.5 billion) because of the ongoing U.S. military operations, then Israel ($2.4 billion) is indeed the top recipient, followed by Egypt ($1.5 billion). That's followed by Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). We found these ratings in the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract, which compiled 2008 military and economic aid. Foreign aid includes things such as money for economic development, agriculture or children's health. In Egypt's case, most of the money in recent years has gone to military aid, particularly heavy equipment such as tanks, helicopters and fighter planes. We should note that Egypt will likely slip a place when the official 2010 figures are released, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Haiti is expected to receive more aid, because of the earthquake that occurred there in 2010. The Globe also reported that much of the aid the U.S. sends to Egypt comes back to the United States when Egypt purchases weapons from U.S. defense manufacturers.

This was not a real Fox News chyron - if one looks at the top right corner of the image, the logo for the comedy program 'The Daily Show with Trevor Noah' is visible, meaning the image was created by comedy writers for the Comedy Central parody news show to poke fun at the way Hannity, a vocal supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, would be expected to cover Trump's Democratic successor, U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has been widely criticized for his administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Trump administration oversaw 400,000 U.S. fatalities from the disease, with over 100,000 occurring during Trump's final 36 days in office, when he was accused of abdicating his official duties as he embarked on a quest to overturn the November 2020 election results. Even though the altered image was a joke, 'The Daily Show' writers weren't that far off the mark from reality. On the day of Biden's inauguration, Hannity complained on his radio show that Biden was 'minimizing' the pandemic, stating: They're minimizing, I noticed, on getting COVID under control.

23139,12331,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/malinda-borden-titanic-lifeboats/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"A photograph purportedly showing a woman named 'Malinda Borden' is frequently shared on social media along with the claim that she had worked aboard the RMS Titanic and drowned at sea when that ship sank on its maiden voyage, as lifeboat seats were only made available to white passengers. Her name, according to the viral Facebook post, was nearly lost to history because the black workers who perished during the disaster were listed as property that was lost, rather than being included in the list of victims: TITANIC VICTIM MALINDA BORDEN was drowned at sea as she was working aboard the Titanic. Life boats were made available to WHITE women and WHITE children ONLY. The Black workers were not listed among the passengers or victims. They were only listed among property that was lost. #BlackHistoryicon This claim has been working its way online since at least 2016. While we have been unable to determine the specific origins of this photograph, we can say that this Facebook post does not relay an authentic story about the Titanic tragedy. A number of the details in the post are contradicted by what we know about the event. For example, the post suggests that a number of the workers aboard the Titanic were black, and that they were prevented from boarding lifeboats due to their race. However, that simply wasn't the case: black persons were nearly entirely absent from the ship, either as passengers or crew, due to racial discrimination laws of that era. The Solid Rock Herald, an 'afro-American press' outlet, noted in their condolences after the Titanic's sinking that it could be 'safely calculated that no member of the colored race lost their lives in this awful catastrophe owing to certain conditions over which we have no control': We were unable to find any record of a black person working among the crew of the Titanic, let alone a black woman. Only two dozen women were among the Titanic's crew of 900, none of them named Malinda Borden. Apparently the liner had only one black family among its passengers, headed by a man named Joseph Phillippe Lemercier Laroche. The Haitian-born Laroche, his white, French-born wife, Juliette, and their two mixed-race children, Simonne and Louise, were second-class passengers aboard the Titanic when it sank in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg. Juliette and the children survived the ordeal, but Joseph was among the over 1,500 people who died: While this Facebook post would lead us to believe that Laroche's name was listed among the 'property' lost, Laroche and his family were in fact listed as missing persons in a report published in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle the morning after the sinking: The following is a list of those not accounted for. It is an elimination of the passengers reported saved. The record has been compiled with the greatest care. Owing to the confusion in the transmission by wireless of the names of the survivors, it is expected that some errors have been made. Many of those in this list of not accounted for will doubtless be reported saved later. Tue, Apr 16, 1912 - Page 2 · The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, Kings, New York) · Newspapers.com We should note that Laroche was not a slave, but an engineer returning to his home country of Haiti in search of a better job to provide for his family. While racial discrimination was certainly prevalent in the early 1900s, it's inaccurate to say that black people aboard the Titanic were denied spots on the lifeboats specifically due to their race - largely because of the absence of black passengers on the ship in the first place. Furthermore, contemporaneous news articles document that the one black passenger who died during the disaster was indeed listed among the victims and not, as suggested by the viral Facebook post, as 'lost property.' The viral photograph does not appear to show any identifiable passenger or crew member who was aboard the Titanic. We could not find the name 'Malinda Borden' among any of the available passenger or crew lists, and the Titanic Historical Society mentioned only the Laroche family when discussing black persons who were aboard the ship. It appears that this photograph is entirely unrelated to the Titanic, and that its accompanying back story was made up.","Did a Black Woman Named Malinda Borden Perish Because Titanic's Lifeboats Were 'Whites Only?'

15713,2941,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-climate-change-admission/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Radio personality Hal Turner ran a segment on Aug. 8, 2019, that purported to report on an admission from NASA that climate change does not occur from human-made factors. This journalistic 'scoop' did not come from a whistleblower or leaked documents, Turner stated, but from a 20-year-old educational feature on NASA's publicly accessible online magazine, Earth Observatory: On its Earth Observatory web site, NASA published in the year 2000, the information they possessed about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, which was PROVED to be fact by core samples from the earth's seas. Climate Changes - warming and destructive weather - happen naturally from changes in earth's solar orbit, and the extent of earth's axis tilt. NOT from man-induced factors! This story was picked up by the website Natural News, where it gained further virality. One of the more telling approaches for outlets that promote a specific brand of climate-change denial is to report as news their 'discovery' of something that, while perhaps new to them, is fundamental to the field of climate science and in no way in conflict with the concept of anthropogenic climate change. When climate scientists discuss evidence for anthropogenic changes in the climate system, they do not simultaneously argue that there are no natural causes of variation in the climate system. Asserting that would be a straw-man argument. Evidence of natural climate variability is not evidence of a lack of human input into the climate system. That is, however, the sole premise both the Natural News and Hal Turner posts work with, per Natural News: It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth's axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as 'warming' (or 'cooling,' depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words. (As an aside, 1958 was the year NASA was founded. It holds zero specific relevance to the history of Milankovitch cycles.) What are Milankovitch cycles? As accurately copied and pasted from NASA's website, Milankovich cycles do indeed describe three periodic variations in the way the Earth rotates around the sun. Eccentricity describes the shape (how circular or oblong the path is) of Earth's orbit around the sun. That shape varies over long periods of time between nearly a perfect circle and slightly oval-shaped orbit. The eccentricity cycle, from circular to oval and back to circular, lasts (in simplified terms) roughly 100,000 years. Another cycle, precession, describes how the orientation of Earth's axis varies over time such that the North Pole is not always pointed at the North Star as it is today. Instead, it cycles like a slightly off-center toy top, returning to its original position every 26,000 years. The final cycle, axial tilt or obliquity, describes the angle at which Earth's axis is tilted. This angle, which is responsible for our seasons, is not fixed and ranges between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle that lasts 41,000 years. Knowledge of these cycles, each of which affects aspects of the climate system in different ways, is immensely helpful to scientists - especially climate scientists. Combining the relative input of each of these cycles, scientists can mathematically determine how much solar energy any given part of the Earth's surface would have received at any time going back (or forward) in time. In geologic records of past climate, the rhythm of this cycle can be seen in intricate detail such that it can be used to figure out how much time a given rock or core sample represents. This holds up even if that rock was deposited alongside dinosaurs millions of years in the past. Do Milankovitch cycles prove that anthropogenic climate change is a hoax? Milankovitch cycles do not complicate the scientific observation that human-released CO2 is causing an observable net increase in global temperatures. Milankovitch cycles operate on time scales that are vastly greater - tens to hundreds of thousands of years - than the timescales at issue for anthropogenic global warming. Left to its own devices, the orbital arrangement our planet currently finds itself in would likely keep us in the current interglacial period (not a widespread ice age, not an ice-free world) we currently find ourselves in for another 50,000 years - a relatively quiet period of time from a Milankovich perspective. In other words, Milankovitch cycles cannot address rapid rises in temperatures that are currently being witnessed on human time scales - events occurring on time periods that represent a fraction of even the shortest Milankovitch cycle. The concern is what added effect humans are putting into the system on top of the more slowly varying orbital changes. The assertion that NASA is 'admitting' anything by acknowledging the not-at-all controversial existence of Milankovitch cycles is false, and a full article alleging as such betrays nothing but an ignorance of the field such outlets claim to be exposing.","Did NASA 'Admit' Climate Change Is Caused by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Not Humans?

We'll note from the top there are different ways to measure graduation rates, depending on how you account for things such as students who take more than four years to earn a diploma and those who obtain equivalents such as a GED. The National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for education data, calculates something called the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR) for students in public high schools. It estimates the rate of public school students who started as freshmen and finished high school within four years -- in other words, those who graduated 'on time.' (We'll also note that while the government tracks enrollment for private high school students, it doesn't track graduation rates. About 15 million students attend public high schools and about 1.3 million attend private high schools; that means about 8 percent of all students are in private high schools.) Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert cited the most recent AFGR to support the first part of Ryan's claim -- that 'one out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma.' The figures show that in the 2008-2009 school year, the AFGR was 75.5 percent. To express that another way, three out of four high school students graduated on time -- or, as Ryan put it, one in four did not. (Wisconsin, by the way, had the highest graduation rate: 90.7 percent.) Separately, we found that Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, a nonprofit research center and publisher of Education Week, found a nearly identical result using a different calculation.

Colin Powell, the retired Army general and secretary of state, is the founding chairman of the alliance, which is dedicated to helping children and youth. Again, we're dealing only with public school students.

Milwaukee Public Schools' high school graduation rate for 2009 was listed at 52.6 percent, ranking 45th.) We also contacted some other national experts on high school graduation.

That's a flat declaration of a specific figure. Let's see if it's on the money. Ryan's evidence To back Ryan's statement, his office cited a February 2016 article from MarketWatch.com, which reported on Obama's proposal for a $10 tax on each barrel of oil to pay for 'clean' transportation projects such as expanding mass transit. The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years. To be clear, the article said the proposal 'isn't expected to go far.' And in a news release Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is 'dead on arrival in Congress.' The MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: 'This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it's clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb.' So, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst's estimate. But it's only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax. What the oil companies would do isn't quite as certain as what Ryan claimed. A trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, warned the tax would 'harm consumers.' But it hedged a bit in saying the tax 'could' raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. Economist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at 22 cents, the Huffington Post said 22 to 24 cents, and the Washington Post said 24 cents. Politico and Forbes said about 25 cents. One note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. But that's a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies.

In response to comments about this issue posted on their Facebook page by concerned customers, representatives from Suave confirmed that thioglycolic acid (typically used as a depilatory and in hair perming kits) was not present in those products: A second article - now no longer available - was posted to the Facebook page of a hair salon, urging users to avoid the same brand of hair care products because they supposedly contain formaldehyde, 'Laureth 9,' and possibly dioxane, ingredients which in combination, according to this post, 'create a contamination'). As with the first claim, none of the listed substances appeared in either product's ingredients list. The second post appeared to have conflated Suave brand shampoos and conditioners that are currently available for retail purchase with a separate 'hair smoothing' kit that was discontinued in 2012. In 2013, plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleged that Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30-Day Smoothing Kit, a hair treatment product for women who wanted 'smooth, shiny manageable hair with no frizz' (but was not a shampoo or cleansing product) 'contains an ingredient or combination of ingredients that causes significant hair loss upon proper application' and that Unilever, Suave's parent corporation, knew this but failed to disclose that fact. Those allegations primarily hinged on damage putatively caused by the extended use of thioglycolic acid on hair as a relaxant and expressed ancillary concerns involving the use of a supposedly carcinogenic common preservative: The product claimed to be based in keratin, a protein naturally found in hair and would not contain dangerous chemicals, but pictures attached to the complaint showed some women suffering visible bald spots, broken and discolored hair, and burned scalp ... The plaintiffs claimed the product deceivingly used an ingredient that would release formaldehyde - a cancer-causing substance that could also lead to symptoms including irritation, skin sensitivity and breathing difficulties, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The 2013 suit was settled in 2014, by which time the treatment product in question had long since been removed from the market. The ingredient mentioned in the lawsiot (DMDM Hydantoin) is an extremely common antibacterial agent and preservative that works to release formaldehyde in small quantities, but is not itself 'formaldehyde' and is not linked with hair breakage or loss. Regarding the use of formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in consumer products, manufacturer Procter & Gamble explains that they are present in quantities far too small to pose safety concerns: Formaldehyde occurs widely in fruits, vegetables, meats, and your own body, as it is formed naturally in small amounts by your breakdown of food into energy. Similarly, formaldehyde releasing preservatives, such as DMDM hydantoin, release very tiny amounts of formaldehyde, just enough to keep products from spoiling, but well below safe amounts. The formaldehyde releasing preservative we use is mainly DMDM hydantoin, but we also use Imidazolidinyl urea, Diazolidinyl urea, and Quaternium-15 in a very few products where they would be disclosed on the label. Suave brand shampoos and conditioners do not contain thioglycolic acid (nor formaldehyde), and 'formaldehyde releasing' preservatives are in no way exclusive to Suave products nor known to harm the health of consumers or their hair. Its presence in personal care topical products is extremely common and a method of inhibiting the growth of bacteria. In other words, if that ingredient was causing hair loss, it would not be exclusive to products from Suave.",Does Suave Shampoo Contain an Ingredient That Causes Hair Loss?

Since at least December 2020, online advertisements have displayed a picture of a Ziplock bag covering a car's side mirror. The ads appeared to promise a handy trick for drivers: The ad read: 'Put A Ziplock Bag Over Your Car Mirror, Here's Why.' Another claimed: '[Pics] Always Place A Plastic Bag On Your Car Mirror When Traveling Alone, Here's Why.' They led to websites such as Livestly, Free Hub, The Delite, and others. Readers who followed the clickbait ads were led to lengthy slideshow articles. Unfortunately, it was a waste of time, because the stories never ended up mentioning why a Ziplock bag should be put on a car mirror. Instead, the articles listed household 'life hacks.' One of the articles continued for more than 90 pages. For example, one piece of advice was about pouring vinegar on bread. We previously reported on the subject. Another trick was about pouring dish soap down drains. We covered that as well. Other advice included purported uses for pot handles holes, rear-view mirrors, and aluminum foil packaging. While the ads were misleading, there is a legitimate reason to put Ziplock bags over a car's side mirrors. In 2016, the website for home improvement guru extraordinaire Bob Vila recommended the trick to keep ice and snow from collecting on the mirrors in cold weather: Ice is one of winter's hazards-both on the road and on your car. It's always best to park in your garage or covered carport to prevent ice from forming on your windshield and rearview mirrors. But for those who are stuck with parking en plein air, here's a clever trick. Just open up a few Ziplock bags and slip them over your mirrors.

We found strong evidence to back the claim on the 34, recognizing there is no one definitive source on the question. We rate the statement True.","As the nation observes the 400th anniversary of slavery, a Chicago documentary filmmaker tweeted about the painting Declaration of Independence, which hangs in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. The painting depicts a moment in 1776 showing 47 men, including Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock and Ben Franklin, most of whom were signers of the declaration. 'This is one of the most famous paintings in American history: Declaration of Independence,' Arlen Parsa wrote above an image of the 1818 oil by John Trumbull. 'I decided to put red dots on all the men who held slaves. Next time someone puts them on a pedestal and says we can't question their judgement on guns or whatever, show them this image.' So, Parsa claims that 34 of the 47 founding fathers shown in the painting were slaveholders. With the caveat that there is no one definitive source on this question, we also counted 34. A research challenge We contacted more than a dozen historians and historical organizations. None knew of a list that identified how many of the men in the painting were slaveholders. 'I would have assumed that it would be easy to find out how many owned slaves, but it is surprisingly elusive,' Baylor University history professor Thomas Kidd told us. Starting with evidence Parsa provided to back up his claim, we did our own research on each of the 47. (This chart identifies all 47.) Go here to see a spreadsheet detailing the evidence we examined. 'Most of the quantification is best-guess and based on available records,' said historian Terry Bouton at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. 'The problem is that property records are pretty spotty for the more obscure founders and even some of the bigger names.' But, using books, historical organizations, research articles and other sources, we found there is strong evidence to back Parsa's claim. The slaveholders tended to be men of means, including landowners, doctors, lawyers and local government officials. Here are the 34 men in the painting we found to be slaveholders, in alphabetical order by last name: Josiah Bartlett, Charles Carroll, Samuel Chase, Abraham Clark, George Clinton, John Dickinson, William Floyd, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Benjamin Harrison, Joseph Hewes, Thomas Heyward Jr., William Hooper, Stephen Hopkins, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee. And Francis Lewis, Philip Livingston, Robert R. Livingston, Thomas Lynch, Arthur Middleton, Lewis Morris, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Read, Benjamin Rush, Edward Rutledge, Richard Stockton, William Whipple, Thomas Willing, John Witherspoon, Oliver Wolcott and George Wythe. The men who did not own slaves also tended to be well-to-do. Here are the 13 who apparently did not own slaves: John Adams, Samuel Adams, George Clymer, William Ellery, Elbridge Gerry, Samuel Huntington, Thomas McKean, Robert Treat Paine, Roger Sherman, Charles Thomson, George Walton, William Williams and James Willson. Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz noted that at least three men in the painting, including Franklin, were or later became abolitionists. Also, in 1776, slavery was legal in all 13 of the new states and was 'condoned by the entire West,' including Britain and France, he said. 'As the men who drafted and signed the Declaration were mostly gentlemen of standing and property, it's not at all surprising that this would be the case,' Wilentz added. Brown University emeritus history professor Gordon Wood said Parsa's claim reveals how prevalent slavery was. But, 'what's important is that slavery began to be attacked and eliminated from that moment on,' Wood said. 'The first anti-slave convention in history was held in Philadelphia in 1775. The American Revolution made slavery a problem for the world when it had not been a problem before, having existed for thousands of years without substantial criticism. All this is lost in today's climate.'",,,,Thirty-four of the 47 men depicted in the famous 'Declaration of Independence' painting were slaveholders.,supported,true,,politifact

However, we found no solid evidence that Biden actually said the fall of the Shah was a step forward for human rights in Iran. Experts will continue to debate whether foreign policy decisions of Gates and Biden will be viewed favorably by historians. But Gates portrayal of Biden's record was accurate, with the exception of the unproven claim about Biden's comments on Iran. We rate Gates' statement Mostly True.","A new memoir from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates hit the book shelves this month, drawing both praise and criticism for its candid insights into the two most recent presidents Gates worked for, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and their administrations. Washington reporters immediately latched on to Gates' portrayal of Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, he said, is a nice guy - 'simply impossible not to like' - but 'wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.' Ouch. Asked to back up his harsh words Jan. 13, 2014, on National Public Radio's Morning Edition, Gates replied: 'Frankly, I believe it. The vice president, when he was a senator - a very new senator - voted against the aid package for South Vietnam, and that was part of the deal when we pulled out of South Vietnam to try and help them survive. He said that when the Shah fell in Iran in 1979 that that was a step forward for progress toward human rights in Iran. He opposed virtually every element of President Reagan's defense build-up. He voted against the B-1, the B-2, the MX and so on. He voted against the first Gulf War. So on a number of these major issues, I just frankly, over a long period of time, felt that he had been wrong.' This is not an argument without consequence. Biden served for years on the Foreign Relations Committee, including several stints as chairman, and he was picked as Obama's running mate in part because of his experience in world affairs. For someone of Gates' stature to publicly criticize a sitting vice president is uncommon. We can't - and won't - weigh in on whether Biden was on the right or wrong side of history. That's a debate that likely will never end. Nor are we stipulating that Gates' examples are the definitive list by which the last 40 years of U.S. foreign relations will be judged. But we did wonder if Gates' description of Biden's history was accurate. That led us to this review of the career of a man who first entered the Senate in 1973 and who twice has acted on his presidential ambitions and may again in 2016. History between Biden and Gates Biden won his first election in 1972 at just 29, fueled by the anti-war sentiments of a generation wary of the Vietnam conflict. Biden later said he 'wasn't against the war for moral reasons; I just thought it was stupid policy.' At other times in his career, Biden advocated for military intervention. Most notably, Biden was an early and instrumental advocate of military intervention in the Serbia and Kosovo conflicts during the Clinton administration. He reportedly called Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milosevic 'a damn war criminal' to his face and later said his work in the Balkans was one of his two 'proudest moments in public life.' Biden and Gates have not always disagreed. In his memoir Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, Gates recalled fighting military leaders in 2007 to get more money to protect troops on the ground against roadmines. It was Biden who offered an amendment to fund Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to the tune of $1.5 billion. It passed unanimously. But there's clearly tension between Gates and Biden. Gates wrote that just sitting next to Biden was 'awkward' because they so frequently were at odds. Biden is mentioned on nearly six dozen pages of Gates' 600-page memoir, often in an unflattering light. Biden, too, has not always been so kind to Gates. When President George H.W. Bush nominated Gates to director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1991, Biden not only voted against his confirmation, he openly criticized Gates. 'I believe it is time for us to look forward. I have been disappointed in the past in Mr. Gates' analytical skills, especially in regard to the Soviet Union,' Biden said, according to the Senate record. 'I have chosen to err on the side of new thinking.' A few minutes later, Gates won confirmation by a vote of 64-31. When Gates was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate 95-2 to Secretary of Defense under the second Bush, Biden was one of three senators not to vote. Clearly, these two men have some history. But what about Gates' claims regarding Biden's record? Let's go through them one by one. Biden 'voted against the aid package for South Vietnam.' On April 10, 1975, President Gerald Ford requested Congress to provide nearly $1 billion in military and humanitarian aid to South Vietnam within nine days. By this point, American intervention in Vietnam was waning after two decades of involvement, and Ford's request was the final attempt to bring U.S. assistance to the war-torn country. On April 25, 1975, the Senate approved a conference report to provide some financial assistance on a 46-17 vote. Biden, just two years after taking office, voted against the measure. The bill ultimately died in the House. And on April 29, as the South Vietnam capital of Saigon was captured, Ford order an evacuation of all remaining U.S. personnel from Indochina. Biden said when 'the Shah fell in Iran in ... 1979 ... that that was a step forward for progress toward human rights in Iran.' We were not able to find evidence that Biden spoke positively of the fall of the Shah. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was the leader of Iran until January 1979, when he and his family were forced out of the country by backers of Ruhollah Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini, an exiled cleric critical of the regime. Khomeini returned to the country in February 1979 to claim power as supreme leader and proclaim the Islamic Republic of Iran, the state it remains in today. An extensive search through newspaper archives found no instances of Biden speaking positively of the Shah's ouster. Jules Witcover, author of Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption, does not recall coming across such a statement in his research, either. We found reference to the statement in a 2008 opinion piece published by the New York Post that heavily criticized Obama's choice of Biden as his VP. But there was no source for it. The comment has continued to circulate in conservative media, again without citation. We contacted both the Post and the author to ask for a source, but we didn't hear back. Through a publicist, we asked Gates to back up the claim. They simply referred us back to his book. We found no other source for this statement, and especially no original citation, so we have significant doubts that it's accurate. We will update this point if more evidence comes to light. Biden 'opposed virtually every element of President Reagan's defense build-up. He voted against the B-1, the B-2, the MX and so on.' Following World War II, the United States' approach to the Soviet Union and the spread of communism centered on containment. President Ronald Reagan changed that, said Barry Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a national security think tank. 'If you read through key national security documents written under Reagan, they basically turn their back on containment and say, 'we can win this thing,'' Watts said. 'And the defense build-up under Reagan is the concrete substantiation to put increased pressure on (the Soviets).' During the next eight years, Reagan would push Congress to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on defense. One such proposal was to bring back the B-1 bomber, a plane canceled under President Jimmy Carter. On Dec. 3, 1981, Biden voted for an amendment to eliminate funds for the B-1 from the defense appropriation bill. The amendment failed, and the defense spending bill passed the Senate a day later with $2.4 billion for the B-1. Biden did not vote on the Senate bill. The same bill also contained $2 billion for the MX, an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the 'Peacekeeper.' Biden voted for an amendment that would have eliminated some funding for the MX, which failed. The B-2, also known as the 'Stealth bomber,' was a secret project for much of the 1980s. Funding for the project was included in the 1987 defense spending bill, but the amount was classified. Biden voted for the final bill, but we could not find his position on that particular appropriation. However, from 1989 to 1992, Biden continually voted for measures that stripped funding from the B-2 project, according to voting record scorecards kept by the Council for a Livable World, a group that advocates for nuclear arms control. As for the rest of the defense build-up, Biden voted in favor of the final military spending compromise resolutions passed by Congress throughout the Reagan years, his office noted. But he also often voted against many of the administration's military priorities during the amendment phase. Biden annually earned high ratings in the 1980s voting scorecards from the Council for a Livable World, which generally opposed Reagan's defense build-up. The exception was in 1987 and 1988, when he earned low marks after missing many of the votes while running for president. Biden 'voted against the first Gulf War.' Biden was a staunch opponent of the first invasion of Iraq in 1991 under President George H.W. Bush. The day before the vote, he delivered a blistering speech against the war and accused Bush of threatening to usurp the constitution to commit troops without congressional consent. But Biden was not alone in his dissent. The House had its longest debate in the history of the chamber in deciding whether to go to war, according to the Los Angeles Times, and the Senate only narrowly passed the joint resolution authorizing use of force in Iraq, 52-47. Biden voted no, citing a torn Congress and country. 'Even if you win today, you still lose,' Biden said on the day of the vote. 'The nation is divided on this issue.'",,,,"On foreign policy, Joe Biden was against aid for Vietnam, said the fall of the Shah was 'a step forward' for human rights in Iran, opposed Reagan's defense build-up and voted against the first Gulf War.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact
18084,5924,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/illegal-sell-homes-flint/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In January 2016, an event known as the 'Flint water crisis,' pertaining to lead contamination in the city's water supply and a resulting emergency in the area, emerged as a major news story. The unfolding event led to a number of rumors, including one that Child Protective Services (CPS) was threatening to take children from affected homes (which was false), and another that maintained it was illegal for Flint homeowners to sell their properties in the city due to the crisis. The Child Protective Services rumor originates with a publication called The Free Thought Project, which also published an article holding that: Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government's responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill. As with the CPS story, the portion claiming that the government had made it illegal to sell homes in Flint stemmed from a single, unvetted source, in this case a Flint resident's comment captured in a Russia Today video clip. At approximately the 1:06 mark of the clip, the resident states that 'it's illegal to sell your home with a known copper and lead problem,' a statement widely interpreted both in media reports and on social media sites to mean that all home sales in Flint were consequently illegal: Flint resident Melissa Mays repeated the claim in a Huffington Post article published on 27 January 2016: And why don't we move? Well, it is illegal to sell your home with a known copper and lead problem. And who would buy my poison water house anyway? We have no options. In an attempt to clarify the claim, we contacted relevant state agencies in Michigan as well as several local real estate businesses. Representatives from both Coldwell Banker and Century 21 in Flint stated they were aware of no such regulation or legal restriction on selling homes, and that property sales in Flint have not been affected by any restriction on real estate transactions. We asked whether it was expressly illegal to sell a home in which pipes required replacement, and both representatives said that the scenario would be covered in disclosures related to the transaction. (Problems relating to the home would fall under the auspices of the seller's disclosure, whereas local infrastructure matters would be disclosed by the listing broker.) On Reddit, an individual poster represented as a Flint resident expressed frustration and skepticism with both rumors, citing his own experiences and observing that the speculation failed to take into account that the situation on the ground in Flint is an emergency: This article is complete bullshit. The city announced last week that NO ONE is getting shut-off and that they actually reconnected anyone that had been shut off since October. Source - what I was told at Flint city hall last week when I went to pay my water bill. I replied 'about fucking time' and left without paying. My service is still on. I'd like to see one single source from that article other than that the writer apparently scanned through some news articles before writing this. WHO SAID IT'S ILLEGAL TO SELL YOUR HOME IN FLINT? WHO SAID THEY ARE REMOVING CHILDREN FROM HOMES? If the author is assuming normal state laws apply to Flint, they are an idiot as we are in an OFFICIAL EMERGENCY. I am a Flint resident and this whole article is complete and utter bullshit. I mean, it says we're still paying for bottled water. They've been giving it away for free, even dropping it off at people's houses, since last weekend. Bullshit. Aside from statements made by one person in two interviews, we were unable to track down any information that substantiated the claim it is expressly illegal to sell homes in Flint due to the water crisis. Mays' assertion that buyers might be less keen on purchasing a home in Flint until the crisis was resolved were plausible, but it doesn't appear that any legal restrictions prevent residents of that town from selling their homes. On 29 January 2015, a representative from MDHHS's Joint Information Center responded to our inquiry: The rumor that it is illegal to sell homes in Flint is entirely false. Under the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, there are lead-based paint disclosure requirements. But when it comes to lead in water for homes in Flint, while there are no similar requirements, we do recommend that individuals looking to buy or sell homes in Flint consider having their water tested. Water testing continues to be available through the City of Flint, or Flint Water Plant by calling 810-648-6942.","FALSE: Illegal for Flint Residents to Sell Homes The Flint water crisis led to a number of rumors, but claims that selling homes in Flint was illegal weren't substantiated by anything other than anecdotes.

Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TV's 'UpFront' program. 'We need better information. More explanations,' said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. 'They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of.' Contact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps. It's a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread. Does Wisconsin really have no such program 'to speak of'? Tracing ramp up hasn't always been smooth Asked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this: 'The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isn't enough.' Zimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system. For instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published. A story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program. State and local officials have been tracing Health officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers. The number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. 'Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis,' DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. 'What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread - which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly.' DHS doesn't know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments. DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers 'between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments.' The state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide 'surge capacity' for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim. 'The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made,' Goodsitt said. The number of tracers varies widely among some of the state's larger health departments. As of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers. Milwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but it's an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case.",,,,Wisconsin has 'no tracing program going on that we can speak of.,refuted,barely-true,<p>But hundreds of people around the state are doing this tracing work -- local and state health officials both.</p>,politifact

It didn't take long before Michael Wilson, the commission's economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010. At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, that's about 23 percent. But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, 'the simple answer isn't always the most informative answer.' There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops. For starters, that 23 percent figure doesn't include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but it's still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison. Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison. Of the felons convicted of 'person crimes' (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails. The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 'In Oregon, we've always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison,' Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes. And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent. That's not to say that drug offenses aren't felonies -- but it's still important context, especially given that the word 'felony' can describe a number of crimes. There's one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesn't mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs' critique when they note 'contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.' According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month. Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said he'd be surprised if those 25 percent don't serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest. 'I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail,' he said. 'But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.' It's important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. 'I think the more information the public has, the better.'

The story, which ran on the Post's cover the next day, didn't cite a source; it just showed a Reuters photo of a cot that had a copy of the book on it. On April 27, the story link no longer worked and redirected readers to the Post's homepage. Later that day, a revised version of the story was again on the Post's website with an editor's note that said 'the original version of this article said migrant kids were getting Harris' book in a welcome kit, but has been updated to note that only one known copy of the book was given to a child.' Laura Italiano, the reporter who wrote the article, also resigned, saying that she was 'ordered to write' an incorrect story and that she 'failed to push back hard enough.' But claims about the book continue to spread online. 'So the Biden administration is buying Kamala Harris' book with our taxpayer money,' read one Facebook post that shared the Post cover. 'Seems to be a conflict of interest. Who's okay with Vice President Harris making money off this situation?' This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to the White House and the city of Long Beach, which is temporarily hosting migrant children who are staying at an U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shelter there. Kevin Lee, a spokesperson for the city, told PolitiFact that a copy of Harris' book was donated as part of a citywide book and toy drive organized by the city of Long Beach and its convention and visitors bureau to support the children. 'The single book you reference is one of hundreds of various books that have already been donated,' Lee said, adding that it wasn't purchased by Long Beach or the federal government. On April 25, the convention and visitors bureau tweeted that 'the Long Beach community is rallying around the book and toy drive for migrant youth' and thanked 'the many donors who have dropped off new toys and books.' A website for the toy and book drive says that the city is accepting English and Spanish language books suitable for infants to young adults. Sabrina Singh, a White House spokesperson for Harris, told us that 'the office of the vice president was not aware that her children's book was donated.' We've found nothing credible to suggest otherwise, and no evidence that there is a campaign to give every child a copy of the vice president's book on the taxpayer's dime. As the Washington Post reported in its fact-check of Sen.

North Carolina does have financially vulnerable hospitals. A 2020 report from The Chartis Group found six North Carolina hospitals to be among 216 of the nation's 'most vulnerable.' A Sheps Center also found financially-vulnerable hospitals in North Carolina. But there is no ranking among these hospitals. And, based on available data, it's inaccurate for Jackson to suggest that the situation is more dire for rural hospitals in North Carolina than it is for those in other states. Jackson's spokesman acknowledged that Jackson misspoke. What Jackson did say has an element of truth, but certainly leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.","For years now, Democrats in North Carolina have called on the legislature's Republican majority to expand Medicaid. Not only would expansion provide healthcare access to more North Carolinians, Democrats say it would also help bail out hospitals in rural parts of the state that are struggling to make ends meet. State Sen. Jeff Jackson brought up ailing hospitals during a forum for Democratic U.S. Senate candidates in Greensboro on Oct. 11. Jackson is one of several Democrats hoping to secure the party's nomination and win Richard Burr's Senate seat in 2022, when Burr plans to retire. At the Indivisible NC forum, a moderator asked the candidates what they would do to reduce patient costs associated with going to the emergency department. Erica Smith and Richard Watkins talked about increasing access to preventative healthcare through Medicare For All. Jackson emphasized the need to help rural hospitals. And he suggested the situation is more dire in North Carolina than most other states in the country. 'The five most-endangered hospitals in the country are all in our state,' he told the crowd after the 22-minute mark of this video. Is it true that the five most financially vulnerable hospitals are all in North Carolina? Jackson has a point that some of North Carolina's rural hospitals, specifically, are struggling. In fact, experts say some are financially vulnerable - and are among the most struggling in the nation. But Jackson gave a misleading impression when he suggested they alone are at the top of a list of 'the most endangered,' or that North Carolina's situation is worse than other states. Jackson's claim Jackson's campaign said he was referring to a 2020 report by The Chartis Group, a firm that studies healthcare and has analyzed available hospital data. The group developed a statistical model that identifies 'key indicators most likely to impact a hospital's ability to sustain operations during the critical tipping point window.' Of the 216 hospitals Chartis considered to be the 'most vulnerable,' six are located in North Carolina. Jackson 'meant to say that six of the most endangered hospitals in the country are in North Carolina,' campaign spokesman Dylan Arant told PolitiFact NC. Several other states have more hospitals in the 'most vulnerable' category than North Carolina, including: Texas (41), Oklahoma (17), Tennessee (15), Mississippi (14) Georgia (13), Alabama (12), Kansas (12), and Missouri (11). While researchers specifically mention those states and others for having the worst situations, they don't single-out the Tar Heel state in their report. North Carolina is only listed among the group's charts. A newer 2021 report from Chartis shows North Carolina with 15 vulnerable hospitals. It again identified about 10 other states - Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas - with a higher number of vulnerable hospitals than North Carolina. Other states also had higher percentages of vulnerable rural hospitals, as well as rural hospitals with worse financial operating margins. Billy Balfour, spokesman for The Chartis Group, said that while its Center for Rural Health analyzes the financial health of rural hospitals, 'we don't rank hospitals based on vulnerability nor do we disclose the names of hospitals identified as vulnerable.' We were curious whether any group of experts tracks the financial health of hospitals and ranks them by how 'endangered' they might be. Representatives for the American Hospital Association, North Carolina Healthcare Association and the National Rural Health Association all said no. Neither does the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit known for its research on healthcare. The University of North Carolina's Cecil Sheps Center for Health Services Research is another one of the most reputable health research groups in the country. The Sheps Center keeps track of financially-distressed hospitals across the country. But it does not rank hospitals by how 'endangered' they are, either, said Mark Holmes, the center's director. What available data show Rural hospitals, particularly in the South, are in more financial trouble than hospitals near urban areas, experts say. And some argue that expanding Medicaid can help. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a mix of state and federal funding from the Medicaid program provided health coverage for low-income families with dependent children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. Additional funding under ACA, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand their Medicaid coverage to a wider range of people, including low-income adults without children. North Carolina is one of 12 states that so far has not accepted the additional funding to expand coverage. Hospitals in states that haven't expanded Medicaid (such as North Carolina) now have higher rates of unrecoverable debt and charity care, according to a 2019 American Hospital Association report. The association found that 80% of rural hospital closures since 2014 have occurred in non-expansion states. 'The pandemic has exacerbated financial challenges for many hospitals, especially for rural hospitals,' Cynthia Charles, a vice president for North Carolina's Healthcare Association, told PolitiFact NC. 'Some of them are having to make some difficult financial decisions,' she said. 'It would help struggling hospitals if the state would expand Medicaid, something being discussed as part of the state budget process.' North Carolina is home to a few hospitals suffering financial distress. In the Sheps Center's most recent 2019 report on financially-distressed rural hospitals, researchers found that Alabama, Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma each had 16 or more hospitals facing a 'high risk' of financial distress. North Carolina has nine rural hospitals at a 'mid-to-high' risk for financial distress and four at a 'high-level' risk for financial distress. North Carolina's total of four hospitals at high-risk was tied for the lowest number among all southern states. 'It is pretty difficult to systematically examine hospitals for their finances,' said Holmes, the Sheps Center's director. 'One can use 'cost reports' required for all hospitals accepting Medicare, but this is no substitute for knowing the details of the hospital.' 'Although we track these using (the financial distress index), it's a model and models are not crystal balls and it would be dangerous to use them that way,' Holmes said.",,,,'The five most-endangered hospitals in the country are all in (North Carolina).,refuted,barely-true,<p>Experts and hospital associations say they're not aware of any credible study or report listing the U.S. hospitals that are most likely to close.</p>,politifact

For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them 'cuts' -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget. $700 billion in Medicare cuts? Because we're wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking? Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally 'cut' a dollar from the Medicare program's budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would 'cut' Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we've rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law's savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it's timing that's making the 'cuts' bigger, not changes to Medicare. Does the Ryan budget 'protect those cuts'? Now onto our second question: Does Ryan's budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes. Here's what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney's running mate: Stephanopoulos: 'You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts. Ryan: 'Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ...' (Read the full exchange.) So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings. The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter's remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare. 'Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama's $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,' said Lanhee Chen, Romney's policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. 'A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.' Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn't have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn't been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office. Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law. That's because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in. Our ruling Cutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but 'Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.' Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan.

By Samantha Putterman • November 5, 2021 Cutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney's plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan. Still, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.","Mitt Romney's pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare. Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Ryan's idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called 'premium support.') Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan's plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan. The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut '$700 billion' out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too! For this check, we're looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom. 'You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,' Cutter said. 'You know what those cuts are? It's taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.'",,,,Says Paul Ryan's budget relies on the same $700 billion in savings from Medicare that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have been attacking Democrats about.,supported,true,,politifact

Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.","The expansion of charter schools has been the subject of contentious debate in Rhode Island in recent years. So much so that state lawmakers are fielding a raft of bills this session aiming to limit charter school growth or change their funding method. Cumberland mother and former educator Erika Sanzi weighed in with a March 5, 2015, commentary in The Providence Journal supporting school choice and charter schools. The piece was entitled 'Taking aim at R.I.'s poor, minority students.' In it, Sanzi faulted the Cumberland School Committee for passing a resolution asking the General Assembly to halt charter school expansion until a new funding mechanism is created. Such a move, would disproportionately impact poor, minority families, she said. She stated, 'Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor (indicating that their family's income qualifies them for free or reduced-priced lunch). In addition, a majority of them are students of color.' We reached out to Sanzi to learn what sources she used to support her statement. We also contacted the Rhode Island League of Charter Schools, which advocates for and supports 18 of the state's 25 charter schools. We quickly learned that there is no firm data on the race, ethnicity or income levels of the large pool of children who are in the lotteries for charter school slots -- the group Sanzi was talking about. However, there is ample data on the children who actually enroll in the schools. As we'll see, that helped us evaluate Sanzi's claim. Stephen A. Nardelli, executive director of the league, told us that the charter school lottery application does not request or require information about a prospective student's ethnicity or socio-economic status. The league does not track such information, but he said that 11,889 students had applied in 2014 for 1,252 openings and that about 7,000 are enrolled overall. We also reached out to the state Department of Education. The state doesn't track the ethnicity or economic status of charter school applicants either, Elliot Krieger, a spokesman for the department, said. But the state does calculate the ethnicity and economic status of students enrolled in charter schools. An April 2014 education department report showed that in October 2013, 52 percent of the students were Hispanic; 16 percent were black; and 6 percent were another ethnicity or multi-ethnic, while 26 percent were white. Across Rhode Island, Hispanics comprised 23 percent of the state's total public school student population, 8 percent were black, 62 percent white and 7 percent were another ethnicity or multi-ethnic, according to the report. That same report showed that 67 percent of the charter school students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches, a key indicator of poverty. That compared with 47 percent of public school students overall. Both sets of figures were close to those in Sanzi's claim. When Sanzi got back to us, she acknowledged that the state doesn't track the makeup of those applying to charter schools, but she produced two reports based on more current Department of Education numbers. Her calculations, which used data on school enrollments over the course of the entire 2013-2014 school year, placed the percentage of charter school students that qualified for free and reduced-price lunches at 72 percent. Her calculations on the ethnic makeup of charter schools were based on October 2014 data. They showed that the ethnic composition of the charter school population had remained basically steady from 2013 to 2014, with Hispanics comprising 54 percent of the student body; blacks 16 percent; whites 25 percent; and other ethnicities 6 percent. She also cited a lottery report from Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy, the only school to collect information on its applicants. The school found that 69 percent of the applicants qualified for free and reduced-price lunches in 2013-2014 and that the percentage climbed to 72 percent the next school year. Sanzi noted that, according to the state, 78 percent of the charter school students come from just four communities: Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence and Woonsocket. She then looked to the 2014 Rhode Island Kids Count Factbook. That study found high percentages of low income students in each of those four cities: Central Falls (81 percent); Pawtucket (78 percent); Providence (80 percent); and Woonsocket (75 percent). She also cited a report out of the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University that shows that three out of four students in those communities are Latino.",,,,"'Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor ....

James Gallagher claimed 'Government imposed lockdowns do NOT reduce [COVID-19] cases or stop spikes.' Infectious disease experts, however, say government shutdowns do work by reducing social interaction which, when maintained, cuts down on the spread of COVID-19. Several studies, including from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show government-imposed closures, when combined with mask-wearing, social distancing and hand hygiene, are effective. The studies and experts also point out there's no single strategy that works on its own. California officials have imposed business restrictions while promoting additional strategies to combat COVID-19. We rated Gallagher's claim as False. FALSE - The statement is not accurate.","In early December, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a regional stay-at-home order to curb the state's record spread of COVID-19, which has skyrocketed 117% to 1.6 million cases over the past two weeks. The new business and travel restrictions were tied to intensive care unit capacity and kicked in within days across most of the state, shutting down bars, wineries, movie theaters, salons, barber shops, all restaurant dining and limiting retailers to operating at no more than 20% capacity. 'The bottom line is if we don't act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed,' Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference on Dec. 3 when he introduced the order. Shortly after, the state's GOP lawmakers criticized the move, saying it would harm business and claiming there's no evidence government 'lockdowns' work. 'Government imposed lockdowns do NOT reduce cases or stop spikes,' California state Asm. James Gallagher claimed on Twitter. 'Neither science or reality justify the Governor's announcement today - just look at how California's case count compares to less restrictive states.' Gallagher represents much of the northern Sacramento Valley, including Butte, Tehama, Sutter, Yuba, Colusa and Glenn counties. 'By now, it should be obvious that the lockdowns have failed to contain this virus,' added Rep. Tom McClintock, whose district includes Sacramento's eastern suburbs and Sierra Nevada communities, speaking on the U.S. House floor on Dec. 9. For months, there's been robust debate about whether government shutdowns go too far and unnecessarily harm society and the economy. That's a debate that will continue and not something we can fact-check. But Gallagher's claim that government shutdowns don't reduce COVID-19 cases or stop spikes is more clear cut. We sifted through the research and asked public health experts to weigh in. Do Government Shutdowns Work? Experts and several studies show government-imposed shutdowns do work to slow COVID-19 when combined with mask mandates, social distancing and hand hygiene requirements. They also depend on the public's willingness to comply with the orders. Here's one recent example: A state-mandated stay-at-home order in Delaware this spring, combined with public mask mandates and contact tracing, led to an 82% reduction in COVID-19 cases, an 88% drop in hospitalizations and a 100% decline in deaths, according to a November study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'These strategies are effective in limiting potential exposure to [COVID-19] and reducing community transmission when implemented as part of a multicomponent strategy,' the study concluded. 'No single mitigation strategy is likely to be effective alone,' it added. Newsom's new regional stay-at-home order takes a similar approach. It calls for shutting down several business sectors. But it also requires '100% masking and physical distancing,' in sectors that remain open. Nowhere in the order does it say the government shutdowns by themselves are sufficient to slow the virus. Success Depends On Public Cooperation Another study, conducted by economics professors at the University of Kentucky and published in May in Health Affairs medical journal, found that social distancing mandates by state and local governments in the U.S. on average reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases by 5.4% after one to five days, 6.8% after six to 10 days, 8.2% after 11 to 15 days, and 9.1% after 16 to 20 days. Notably, it concluded the 'effectiveness' of these orders 'depends critically on the cooperation of the public.' 'For example,' the study continued, 'although California's first-in-the-nation shelter-in-place order [from March] carries threats of fines and incarceration, its effectiveness fundamentally relies on social pressure.' Lee Riley is professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. He said the confusion over whether shutdowns work is understandable, considering states with some of the toughest mandates are also experiencing the biggest spikes. 'The problem is when these restrictions are eased or lifted, that's when we see the resurgence,' Riley explained. 'This is what people are looking at and saying the restrictions don't work. And that's absolutely incorrect. Restrictions do work.' Riley said places such as China, Singapore and Taiwan all imposed rigorous restrictions and contained the coronavirus spread. 'Yes, the restrictions do work and if they're maintained for a long enough period, then they can eventually mitigate the transmissions completely.' Previous Fact Check Last month, PolitiFact examined a similar claim by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott who said shutdowns are 'ineffective,' before adding that workplace gatherings are not a common way for COVID-19 to spread. For that fact check, experts told PolitiFact that if measuring strictly transmission rates and case numbers, shutdowns have proven to be effective in managing spread. They also noted that Abbott's statement ignores workplaces where proper precautions are difficult to achieve from meatpacking plants to the construction industry. PolitiFact rated Abbot's claim as False. 'Correlation Is Not Causation' In an interview, Gallagher, the California state lawmaker, said he stood by his claim that shutdowns don't reduce cases or stop spikes, describing the evidence as inconclusive. He suggested that the decline in coronavirus cases this spring could have resulted from people's voluntary actions to distance and use good hygiene upon hearing about the virus, and not because of lockdowns. 'Correlation is not causation,' Gallagher said. 'Just because something happens to happen at the same time that you're doing X, doesn't mean that there wasn't some other variable that was leading to that.' Riley said Gallagher's theory doesn't hold up. 'If good hygiene and voluntary social distancing are what contributed to the decrease in cases, why are we seeing another surge all over the country?' the professor asked. 'The point of the lockdowns is to decrease chances of social gathering and social interaction, which is the most effective way to assure social distancing,' Riley added. 'This lawmaker is correct that social distancing works, but lockdowns help to increase the social distancing.' Gallagher provided links to several opinion pieces and letters that he said demonstrate lockdowns don't work. One was a link to the Great Barrington Declaration, a letter three scientists authored that endorses herd immunity and supports a completely reopened society for those with no underlying health conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its publication in early October, however, PolitiFact found the document has been widely criticized by scientists and denounced by top health officials and thousands of doctors around the world. The paper was signed by scientists and health experts across the world. But a British broadcast station found that some of those who signed the letter online used fake names, including 'Dr. Person Fakename' and 'Dr. Johnny Bananas.' The signatures were later made private. Gallagher also cited an opinion piece by a chief investments officer for an analytics firm; a free-market think tank's magazine column that cites the Great Barrington Declaration; an article in the journal Nature that says a combination of 'non-pharmaceutical interventions,' such as business closures, social distancing or mask-wearing, 'is necessary to curb the spread of the virus,' but that less disruptive restrictions can be as effective as more drastic ones. Additionally, Gallagher cited a study published in Safety Science that concluded Germany's decline in COVID-19 infections in the spring was due to the cancellation of mass events and voluntary behavior changes, but not the government restrictions that followed. Germany announced it will start a lockdown this week until at least Jan. 10 to curb the spread of the pandemic. The Science Is 'Pretty Clear' Erin Mordecai is an assistant professor in biology at Stanford University whose research focuses on the ecology of infectious disease. She has conducted research on the relationship between virus transmission and mobility data in California and Georgia. She said mobility, measured based on mobile device movements, generally declines immediately following stay-at-home orders. That reduction in mobility corresponds with a decline in transmission and ultimately the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, she said. 'The science shows pretty clearly that non-pharmaceutical interventions---business closures, social distancing, mask-wearing---including so-called 'government lockdowns' do work to slow the spread of COVID-19,' Mordecai wrote in an email. Right now, she added, there's a strong argument for shutting down in- person contact as much as possible. 'If our ICUs are nearing their maximum capacity, as we're seeing here in California now,' she wrote, 'one of our best tools for avoiding a total public health disaster---people dying in hospital hallways, makeshift COVID wards thrown together in gymnasiums, or at home because they're too afraid to go to the hospital---is to rapidly hit the brakes on transmission, which means avoiding contact with others outside our household, especially indoors, where transmission is more likely.' Our Ruling California state Asm. James Gallagher claimed 'Government imposed lockdowns do NOT reduce [COVID-19] cases or stop spikes.'

The tweet from Deputy Press Secretary Cynthia Meyer echoes what has become a talking point among anti-abortion activists, that abortion disproportionately affects the nation's African American population. Nationally, African American women had a higher rate of abortion than whites, Hispanics or Asians, according to 2013 figures. Even so, black women gave birth more than they terminated pregnancies that year. The same was not true for New York City, where more abortions were recorded for black woman than live births in both 2012 and 2013, the most recent available data. We rate this claim True. TRUE -- The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:20 p.m., Dec. 1, 2015: We amended this fact check to clarify that the described 2013 abortion rate for black women related to women aged 15 to 49. This change did not affect our rating.","During the first Democratic presidential debate in October 2015, Hillary Clinton proclaimed, 'We've got to be committed to getting every child to live up to his or her God-given potential.' Cynthia Meyer, who took up the post of deputy press secretary for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in early 2015, fired back with a tweet, 'Would help if they had the chance to be born.' About a month later, in the next Democratic debate Nov. 14, 2015, the episode was repeated. Clinton echoed her earlier comment, again declaring, 'Every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.' This time, Meyer responded by tweeting, 'More black babies are aborted in NYC than born,' followed by the hashtag #blacklivesmatter. NYC meaning the city of New York. The pair of exchanges elicited a strong sense of deja vu, but Meyer's second tweet raised a more specific question about abortion rates among black women in the Big Apple: Are there more abortions by black women in NYC than births? To our inquiry, over email Meyer said her responses were an effort to highlight the value of human life and call attention to NYC's 'startling' numbers, which come from a 2013 report on pregnancy outcomes compiled by the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Vital Statistics. The numbers have been widely reported by conservative media outlets, including a National Review article that Meyer emailed to us. 'To be clear, that tweet came from my personal Twitter account and I was speaking as a private citizen,' Meyer said in an email. 'Happy to defend the stats, though.' Abortions by black women in NYC outpacing births? Figuring out the answer to this question proved rather simple. The first place we went was that 2013 report, the most recent data available, which provides exhaustive breakdowns of birth statistics in New York City. The agency lists pregnancy outcomes by race and ethnicity, as well as by borough, type of birth (live birth, C-section, premature) and health of the mother. According to the report, in 2013 black women accounted for 29,007 terminated pregnancies, representing almost 42 percent of all abortions in the city. That same year, black women in the city gave birth to 24,108 babies. With abortions surpassing live births by nearly 5,000, African American women in the city clearly terminated pregnancies more often than they carried babies to term. Black women terminated pregnancies at a rate of 67.3 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 49, a rate far higher than any other racial or ethnic group. We checked: the statistics were similar the previous year, when African American women in the city had 24,758 births and underwent 31,328 abortions. The numbers for black women in NYC starkly contrasted with women in other racial and ethnic categories. In 2013, births far surpassed abortions for white, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women. Hispanic women accounted for the second-most abortions in the city with 21,555, but they also had 35,581 live births. Asian women had both the fewest abortions and fewest births, while white women accounted for the most births overall and second-fewest abortions. There was less discrepancy between the number of births and terminated pregnancies for black women statewide. In 2013, black women in New York state gave birth to 36,130 babies and underwent 34,960 abortions, according to the state's health department. During the previous year, the numbers were almost dead even, with black women accounting for 36,905 births and 36,633 abortions across the state. The numbers are far different for the four biggest cities in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports births by both county and city, but abortions are only reported by county. We examined the numbers in 2013 for Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis Counties, which contain the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin, respectively. In all four counties, black women had more live births than abortions. The same was true for white women in those counties. For Harris County, which includes Houston, the largest city in Texas and fourth-largest city nationwide, black women had 12,569 live births and 5,515 abortions, while white women accounted for 16,247 births and 2,661 abortions. If you'd like to peruse the numbers for all four counties, we input the data into a Google spreadsheet for easier side-by-side comparison. It's important to note that abortion access across the state of Texas stands in stark contrast to NYC. Texas currently has 19 operating abortion clinics, but that number would drop to 10 if the U.S. Supreme Court allows the state's contested 2013 law to fully take effect. In contrast, New York state has 80 abortion clinics. Attitudes toward abortion also differ greatly between the two states. Nationally in 2009, black women had abortions far more often than white and Hispanic women, according to data compiled in December 2013 by the National Center for Health Statistics. For some perspective, an online search turned up a 2008 Guttmacher Policy Review article by Susan A. Cohen, a vice president for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. Cohen, saying the national abortion rate for black women is almost five times the rate for white women, suggested this is greatly explained by higher incidences of unintended pregnancy among African American residents. Higher rates, Cohen wrote, 'reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time. Moreover, these realities must be seen in a larger context in which significant racial and ethnic disparities persist for a wide range of health outcomes, from diabetes to heart disease to breast and cervical cancer to sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV.' In examining the socioeconomic factors behind this phenomena, Cohen disputed the idea that black women are recruited into having more abortions, a sentiment that has been shared by anti-abortion activists and conservative politicians. These issues were also extensively explored last September by Zoe Dutton in a piece for The Atlantic called 'Abortion's Racial Gap.' GOP leaders have used these statistics to argue against abortion, positing that it disproportionately affects black communities. In August, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson articulated this stance in relation to Planned Parenthood, claiming during an appearance on Fox News that the organization has contributed to abortion being 'the number one cause of death for black people.' The leading causes of death for black Americans are actually heart disease, cancer and stroke, according to the CDC, but Carson's rhetoric speaks to the GOP's broader stance against abortion. The debate over abortion has taken on more fervor in recent years as many states have introduced increased abortion restrictions. Texas has led in this area, in 2013 enacting a law requiring abortion clinics to adhere to the standards of surgical centers and employ doctors with admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. In November 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of those two provisions as undue burdens on women seeking abortions.",,,,'More black babies are aborted in NYC than born.,supported,true,,politifact

Not every single environmental group in the country opposed USMCA - some had no position. But most of the major groups were opposed, including 10 organizations with 12 million combined members who urged Congress not to support the USMCA. We were unable to find any major environmental group that endorsed the deal. We rate Sanders' statement Mostly True.","In the last debate before the Feb. 3 Iowa presidential precinct caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA) did not go far enough to protect the environment or the rights of workers. Moderator: 'But, Sen. Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal [the USMCA]. Are you unwilling to compromise?' Sanders: 'The AFL-CIO does. 'The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal). And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it.' We found Sanders mostly correct in stating major organizations oppose the USMC, although stating that every major organization opposes it was a stretch. Plus, his claims about union support for the deal need some context. Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign pointed to a letter from a group of 10 high-profile environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, Greenpeace, and others, urging Congress to vote against the USMCA. The 10 groups signing the letter have a combined 12 million members. 'We do not get many opportunities to renegotiate trade deals. At this pivotal moment, we cannot afford to lock ourselves into a multi-decade deal that ignores climate change and helps corporate polluters,' the letter stated. However, some large environmental groups did not take a stance on the USMCA. In an email to The Daily Iowan, representatives from the Environmental Working Group, a nonpartisan conservation nonprofit, said the group has no official stance on the USMCA. Likewise, the Union of Concerned Scientists said the USMCA is not an issue the organization is working on or following. The USMCA is the new agreement governing trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, updating the nearly 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. The leaders of the three countries involved in the agreement agreed to the USMCA in November 2018. The USMCA passed the House of Representatives 385-41 on Dec. 19, 2019, and the Senate 89-10 on Jan. 17, 2020, with bipartisan support. Sanders was one of 10 senators to vote no on the agreement. Channing Dutton, a Des Moines-based attorney and member of Citizens Climate Lobby, said most environmental groups would oppose the agreement because the USMCA does not include provisions for climate change in its current form. 'It's a safe bet that every responsible climate change organization would oppose any trade agreement that ignored the effects of climate change or allow easy modification of the agreement because of climate change impacts,' Dutton said. Dutton, who has endorsed businessman Tom Steyer's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, added that the agreement cannot be modified to adapt to worsening climate conditions, echoing the concerns environmental groups expressed that the deal cannot be altered to provide provisions for climate change after it becomes law. 'This is why he [Sanders] said he would not sign the deal without climate change considerations,' Dutton said. 'They use the agreement to stop people, communities, states, and even nations from doing things such as adopting the carbon tax that Citizens Climate Lobby supports.' Mixed support from labor unions Sanders also brought up during the Des Moines debate the USMCA's support among unions. Moderator Brianne Pfannenstiel, the chief politics reporter at the Des Moines Register, said the AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 55 national and international labor unions, supports the deal. The AFL-CIO announced in December 2019 its support for the deal, which it previously opposed, after negotiating with lawmakers to include more provisions for the deal it deemed to be labor-friendly. 'The USMCA is far from perfect. It alone is not a solution for outsourcing, inequality or climate change,' the AFL-CIO said in a prepared statement. 'Successfully tackling these issues requires a full-court press of economic policies that empower workers, including the repeal of tax cuts which reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.' During the debate, Sanders noted that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace (IAM) workers, which has a membership of 600,000, opposes the USMCA. Although the machinist and aerospace union is part of the AFL-CIO, it issued a statement criticizing the USMCA, though it did not cite concerns over climate change. 'U.S. workers have been waiting over 25 years for a responsible trade deal that puts their interests ahead of corporations who are fleeing our shores,' the machinists and aerospace union wrote in the statement. 'They are still waiting. The IAM will oppose NAFTA 2.0.' Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign cited the IAM statement, as well as statements from the National Family Farm Coalition, which has around 450,000 members, and the United Food and Commercial Workers, with 1.3 million members, as evidence of labor unions upset with the USMCA. While some unions are in opposition, other large unions have issued statements of support for the newest version of the USMCA. The Teamsters, a union consisting of truck drivers, mechanical workers and other trades with a membership of 1.4 million, supports the deal. Additionally, the United Steel Workers, with a membership of 860,000, supported the deal, while the United Auto Workers, membership 990,000, did not explicitly support the deal, but said the deal will need to be strictly enforced to prevent the further loss of U.S. auto industry jobs to Mexico. 'We will do all we can to vigilantly monitor the agreement to try to make sure multinational corporations live up to their end of the bargain, but we should have no illusion that our efforts alone will get the job done,' United Auto Workers president Rory Gamble wrote in a prepared statement.",,,,'The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal).

Imagine what could be done with that amount of money. MARTA, metro Atlanta's mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare. Here's a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion. 'An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt' every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed. Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out. The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nation's biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta. The two senators are part of what's been called the 'Gang of Six' -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending. 'Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nation's staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole,' they wrote. 'These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities.' We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers? PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money. There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates. On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion. Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day. If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day. Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem. The senators' op-ed did not detail what time frame they were discussing to spell out their claim. They said they were basing it off Warner's claim that had been checked of what amounted to $5 billion a day and decided to be conservative and chose the $4 billion daily estimate. This year, their claim is off by about $1 billion. Over the last two years, it's correct.

Featured Fact-check Jen Psaki stated on November 15, 2021 in a White House press briefing 'No economist out there is projecting that (the Build Back Better bill) will have a negative impact on inflation.' By Louis Jacobson • November 18, 2021","Four billion dollars. Imagine what could be done with that amount of money. MARTA, metro Atlanta's mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare. Here's a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion. 'An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt' every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed. Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out. The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nation's biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta. The two senators are part of what's been called the 'Gang of Six' -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending. 'Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nation's staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole,' they wrote. 'These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities.' We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers? PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money. There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates. On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion. Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day. If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day. Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem.

He's right, once you take inflation into account and if you use the most recent data available, which goes through 2013. We rate his claim True.","Jeb Bush is making economic opportunity a major theme of his not-yet-official presidential campaign. One of his main gripes with the economy is that income isn't going up. 'If we grew at a far faster rate, the middle would no longer be as squeezed as they are,' Bush said. 'We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery.' Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, made the remarks during a recent visit to Ohio, where he talked with Pittsburgh Tribune-Review political writer Salena Zito before addressing the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting. (Zito paraphrased part of Bush's quote in her article, but she provided us with the full text of Bush's comment.) We knew that the national employment picture has improved, slowly but surely, since the official end of the recession in mid 2009. But has the typical household income in the United States really fallen since the end of the recession? If true, that would be pretty startling. As it turns out, median income has fallen, once you take inflation into account. Here are the details. In September 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau published its annual roundup of data on income and poverty. Table A-2 in the report provides data on the inflation-adjusted, median household income for the most recent 10 years: This shows that, despite a slight uptick between 2012 and 2013, real median household income has fallen since the start of the recovery in 2009 by $2,120. That's about 4 percent, or roughly 1 percent per year, every year. The only caveat we should mention is that the most recent data stops at the end of 2013, and we don't know yet whether income gains accelerated enough in 2014 to make up for the losses between 2009 and 2013. Still, we won't mark down Bush for this, since he was using the most current data available. 'It's sad but true that real median income is below what it was in 2009 and 2010,' said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. 'Real median income kept dropping well after the official end of the recession and has been pretty close to flat since 2011.' She added that the losses have not been experienced equally. Incomes, Sinclair noted, 'have fallen in the lower parts of the income distribution,' whereas the the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, and even more elite segments, have experienced gains. Still, Bush was clearly speaking about the overall national picture, so we find no fault with his claim.",,,,"'We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery.",supported,true,,politifact

[...] In order to get to net-zero emissions, all potential sources need to be considered. Fossil fuels are the largest source, but every sector needs to be scrutinized. Emissions from the agriculture sector have numerous sources. Changes in land use; for instance, when land that served one purpose is then used for another, such as when a rainforest is turned into pasture lead to increased emissions. These changes are not included in the Carbon Majors research, and more importantly, the emission sources they reflect are not either. Put another way, while fossil fuels are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and the study's identification of the sector's 100 worst-offenders is important, other industries (such as the food system and waste-management programs) contribute to global emissions, as well. See below for a 2020 sector-by-sector breakdown of emissions by the World Resources Institute: In sum, we rate this claim 'False.' While the fossil fuel industry accounts for a significant amount of all greenhouse gas emissions, and research analyzing that concept identified dozens of gas or oil companies that pollute the most, no evidence supported the claim as written. 'The point I was trying to make is that any media coverage that reduces the issue to personal choices is incomplete, and [structural] issues should always be central to climate reporting,' Johnson told us. 'Individuals' choices are not unimportant. They just shouldn't be the focus of climate coverage.'","In early September 2021, the below-displayed compilation of alleged tweets were circulating on numerous Reddit threads. CNN supposedly offered several suggestions for how people in their day-to-day life could help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and then a media analyst responded with this critique: '[Reminder] that 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions and presenting the crisis as a moral failing on the part of individuals without noting this fact is journalistic malpractice.' Both tweets were authentic, though originally posted in October 2018. The underlying claim stemmed from Adam Johnson, a writer and co-host of the podcast 'Citations Needed.' In short, his post accused CNN of erroneously framing the crisis as the result of individual choice when, allegedly, just dozens of corporations were responsible for the majority of emissions trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. However, the tweet was misleading based on evidence we outline below. After the post went viral, Johnson acknowledged the post's shortcomings on an April 2020 episode of his podcast, saying: 'The stat, albeit widely reported that way in the press, is deceiving in its media shorthand.' The Story Behind CNN's Tweet Before we identify the claim's flaws, let us provide some context to explain CNN's tweet. On Oct. 8, 2018, CNN tweeted several suggestions for people to help curb greenhouse gas emissions (eat less meat, take car rides or plane trips less often, and replace old thermostats) to promote an article published by the news outlet on the same day titled, 'What the new report on climate change expects from you.' The tweet's reference to 'that new report on climate change' alluded to a multi-chapter document that the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had released the same day. In short, that report compared various strategies for slowing (or pausing) the rate at which Earth's average surface temperature was warming, as well as provided recommendations for governments to consider while establishing regulatory laws. Based on our review of the report, the crux of the CNN tweet mostly aligned with the report's ideas - though it's worth noting the social media post editorialized the IPCC's findings with a 'second person' point of view (it referred to the speaker's audience) and cherry-picked concepts among numerous strategies to mitigate climate change. No, '100 Corporations' Are Not To Blame For '71%' of Global Emissions Now, let us address the veracity of Johnson's commendatory. Based on a cursory Google search for keywords in his tweet, we uncovered a July 10, 2017, article in The Guardian with the headline: 'Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says.' Via Twitter direct messaging, Johnson confirmed with us that he authored the viral social media post based on that headline. We elaborate more on his thinking below. The Guardian article summarized a July 2017 'Carbon Majors' study by an environmental non-profit called CDP and the Climate Accountability Institute, a 'tiny think tank' as defined by the Scientific American. However, here was the problem: The study did not assess all sources of global emissions worldwide (which includes agriculture, transportation, buildings' heating and cooling systems) but rather only analyzed the output of fossil-fuel producers, specifically. Its introduction read: 'This report looks at industrial carbon dioxide and methane emissions deriving from fossil fuel producers in the past, present, and future [...] [It] is aimed at investors wishing to better understand amount of carbon associated with their fossil fuel holdings.' Therefore, The Guardian headline - which did not note the study's strict focus on fossil fuel combustion - was unequivocally misleading. (When contacted by Snopes about the editorial decision, Kerry Eustice, a managing editor, emphasized the article's subhead and several paragraphs within the story's body make clear the referenced companies are fossil-fuel producers, specifically.) The headline appeared to be centered on this finding in the report: The distribution of emissions is concentrated: 25 corporate and state producing entities account for 51% of global industrial [greenhouse gas] emissions. All 100 [fossil fuel] producers account for 71% of global industrial [greenhouse gas] emissions. In other words, almost three fourths of worldwide fossil fuel emissions were indeed linked to just 100 corporations, based on the study. Those companies included Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco), Gazprom OAO, and National Iranian Oil Company. Meanwhile, together, those top-emitting fossil fuel companies produced roughly half of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Shaina Sadai, a Ph.D. in geosciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, elaborated on the researchers' work, as well as explained the consequences of its misinterpretations, in a November 2020 post on Sentient Media. In summary, she said the study focused on 'one piece of the puzzle' - the production of oil, gas, coal, and cement - when total global emissions includes cumulative outputs from other sectors, as well. Sadai wrote: The finding that 100 corporations were responsible for the majority of fossil fuel and cement production emissions is substantial, but it does not tell us about total emissions or about emissions from other sectors.

But she glosses over the fact that unemployment didn't go 'well over 10 percent' in 1982 until after the election, and her use of the overall unemployment rate overlooks an important factor -- that workers this year are likely to have been without jobs much longer. On balance, we rate Jordan's comment Mostly True.","As Democrats grapple with the stagnant economy and President Barack Obama's crumbling approval ratings, expect to hear this comparison a lot: Barack Obama in 2010 = Ronald Reagan in 1982. On the surface, the comparison is compelling. Reagan and Obama succeeded unpopular incumbents and rode a wave of goodwill into office. During their first two years, both presidents faced brutal recessions, and their approval ratings took big hits. Reagan's Republican Party ended up losing 26 House seats in the 1982 midterm elections (increasing the Democrats' majority). Yet only two years later, after the economy had regained its footing, Reagan won a landslide re-election victory. Naturally, Obama partisans hope the same will happen in 2012. So when we heard Mary Jordan, a longtime foreign correspondent with the Washington Post, use this analogy during the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, we decided it was time for a fact-check. Jordan said, 'And remember, folks, that 1982, when Reagan just started out, it was exactly the same point. He was two years into his term. The unemployment was well over 10 percent, and it did come out of it.' We can't yet say how Democrats will fare in November compared with how Republicans did in 1982 and in this item we're only examining unemployment. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates the unemployment rate. In August 1982, two months before the midterm elections, the unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent. In August 2010, it was 9.6 percent. So the numbers are remarkably similar. Even the comparative rise during each president's term was similar. The unemployment rate rose 2.5 points between Reagan's election and the last unemployment survey before the midterm election, compared with 3 points for Obama. Case closed? Not really. For one thing, in 1982, the unemployment rate only rose to 'well over 10 percent,' to use Jordan's words, in October 1982, when it hit 10.4 percent. However, this number was released after Election Day, meaning that it could not have been a factor on voters' minds. It peaked at 10.8 percent in November and December 1982. So while Jordan's number is not far off, it does modestly exaggerate how high voters knew unemployment to be as they prepared to vote. Here's another difference -- the average unemployed worker this year has been jobless much longer than in 1982. In August 1982, the median length of unemployment was 8.7 weeks. In August 2010, it was 19.9 weeks -- more than twice as long. And that's not a blip. For nearly a year, the median duration of unemployment has ranged between 19 and 25.5 weeks. So Jordan is right that there are some similarities between the recessions of 1982 and 2010. But she glosses over the fact that unemployment didn't go 'well over 10 percent' in 1982 until after the election, and her use of the overall unemployment rate overlooks an important factor -- that workers this year are likely to have been without jobs much longer.

But one of the claims is actually true: 'All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange.' To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat. People who don't get insurance through work or other groups will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service. 'This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits,' said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site. The exchange is meant to ensure that people are 'actually getting coverage and not a junk policy,' Tolbert added. We should note that the e-mail says this rule is listed on page 72 of the health care bill. We found that the requirement that insurance companies must conform is also presented much earlier in the bill. We spotted an earlier reference on page 15, Section 101.

13915,950,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iceland-debt-forgiveness/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 29 January 2016, the web site Disclose TV published an article that was rife with sensational and misleading claims, chief among them that the country Iceland had forgiven its entire population of (mortgage) debt, but a 'total US media blackout' prevented most Americans from learning about this remarkable turn of events that had taken place three years earlier: The US Rothschild Controlled Media (RCM) has completely BLACKED OUT/CENSORED any news about Iceland's DEBT FORGIVENESS. If you Google 'ICELAND FORGIVES ENTIRE POPULATION OF MORTGAGE DEBT' you will get 'About 359,000 Results'. Not one of them is a Media Outlet in the US. Not one single Major or Minor news outlet in America has mentioned a single word about this story. This is TOTAL MEDIA CENSORSHIP and a TOTAL MEDIA BLACKOUT, and it should tell you who owns and runs the Media in America. We are allowed to see a tortured, bleeding, dying Gaddafi anywhere, but we are not allowed to know about Debt Forgiveness. There were two major problems with the above-referenced article. First, Iceland did not forgive the debt of its entire population. Second, there was no media blackout imposed on U.S. news outlets about covering the financial crisis in Iceland. The source of this story was a 2012 news broadcast on the Spanish-language network TeleSur. Disclose TV likely chose this Spanish-language broadcast in order to enforce the idea that a 'total US media blockout' had prevented American new outlets from covering the story, which simply wasn't the case. Sources as diverse as Bloomberg, Think Progress, NPR, and the Washington Post all reported on this issue well before 2016. While it's true that searching 'ICELAND FORGIVES ENTIRE POPULATION OF MORTGAGE DEBT' on Google in February 2016 yielded few results from the United States, that wasn't because of a media blackout. One reason for this phenomenon because the issue was three years in the past at that point. Another reason was because the claimed event simply didn't happen: Iceland never forgave its entire population of all their mortgage debt. Reports from 2012 (many of which were written by U.S. media outlets) noted that while Iceland forgave a large amount of mortgage debt in order to boost the economy's recovery from a financial crisis, this action did not entail entirely wiping out all home mortgages held by all citizens of Iceland. Rather, it involved forgiving a portion of some mortgage debt that was tied to inflation: In Iceland, a lot of people have these odd mortgages that adjust with inflation. And when the financial crisis happened, there was a lot of inflation in Iceland. [One woman] remembers getting these statements saying she owed more and more. And I don't mean she just owed more that month. The total amount she owed to the bank went up by 30 percent. It's, like, if you'd borrowed $100,000 for your house, all of the sudden, you owed a $130,000. After the crisis, people were stuck with much larger mortgages than they'd started with. It was this wound that just would not go away. So last year, when Iceland's Progressive Party found itself with very low poll numbers, it proposed the [debt forgiveness] jubilee, though it didn't call it that. The party promised to go back and correct everyone's mortgages - basically, forgive the additional debt everyone had built up in 2008 and 2009. It's a beautiful idea that you could go back in time and try to undo this one very painful part of the financial crisis, make it like it had never happened. One problem with the jubilee idea of forgiving debt is that there's always someone on the other side, someone who lent the money. But there is a plan to make even this part feel painless. The money to pay for the jubilee would come from a tax on three dead Icelandic banks - banks that many people blamed for Iceland's part in the financial crisis. A lot of people were really into the proposal. The Progressive Party ran on the jubilee idea and won. As Bloomberg noted, the mortgage debt forgiveness program reportedly only affected about a quarter of Iceland's population (and given that the home ownership rate in Iceland in 2012 was 77.9%, it's likely that far more than that proportion of the population was carrying mortgage debt): Since the end of 2008, the island's banks have forgiven loans equivalent to 13 percent of gross domestic product, easing the debt burdens of more than a quarter of the population, according to a report published this month by the Icelandic Financial Services Association. The Washington Post's Wonkblog took a more skeptical view of the matter, opining that the Icelandic government's mortgage relief policy hadn't done much more than undo a portion of a serious financial problem that their 'bizarre' laws had made much worse in the first place: Most mortgages are indexed either to a foreign currency or inflation, so the former doubled when the krona crashed and the latter, well, inflated when inflation subsequently took off. The perverse result is that devaluation and inflation have actually made Iceland's household debt problem worse, not better. That's why the headlines about Iceland writing off 13 percent of GDP of household debt are so misleading. That's just making up for the fact - and maybe not even then - that Iceland's bizarre borrowing laws have pushed up their households' debt burdens so much. Iceland's recovery has become a myth wrapped in a legend inside a legend. It let its banks fail, slashed household debt, let its currency collapse, put capital controls in place - and now it's doing better than those countries that did austerity! In reality, Iceland let its banks fail for foreigners, wrote down household debt only after their laws had made it worse, had no choice but to watch the krona plummet, but, at the same time, tried to keep it from plunging too far by limiting how much money people could take out of the country. Or, as one online commentator on the issue observed: This wasn't really much of a jubilee: You have people who got [home] loans they could afford, but which had a provision that could add a lot of principal to the debt if something unexpected happened, which did happen. Then you had some different people pay off the difference. Asking if people are happy about this is like [asking if everybody is happy they] got an inappropriate $100,000 charge on their phone bills, and the government came in and got some rich foreigners to pay it. A more sensible plan might be to say that the lenders' inflation hedge can't be applied as originally specified, and people owe closer to the amount of money they actually got their loans for (rather than the amount of money that's now worth what that money was worth then).",Iceland Forgives Entire Population of Its Debt?

The McCready campaign did not take money from the group and cannot control the independent expenditures of outside organizations, but that doesn't change the fact that the campaign benefited. While we know that Patriot Majority USA is aligned with the Democratic Party and spent most of its money on House Democrats, we didn't find evidence that Pelosi is aligned with Patriot Majority USA. And while the Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC did support the McCready campaign by spending money against Harris, it is not considered a dark money group because it discloses its donors. Therefore, we rate Bishop's statement Mostly True. UPDATE: This story was updated after publication to add McCready's position on changing campaign disclosure laws. This does not change our ruling. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters' Lab and PolitiFact.

To offer ideas for fact checks, email [email protected].","In a tight 2018 congressional race that is now being redone because of allegations of election fraud, Democratic candidate Dan McCready spoke out on Twitter against dark money in politics. But now he is being accused of benefiting from it. McCready's opponent in the do-over election, Republican Dan Bishop, called him out in a May 31 Facebook post for receiving support from dark money organizations, citing an article by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political journalism website. 'Turns out 'Wrong Dan' (McCready) got nearly $1 million in support from a Nancy Pelosi aligned dark money org in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, 'Dark money has no place in our politics,'.' Bishop's post says. PolitiFact North Carolina found this claim particularly interesting because McCready has been outspoken about his opposition to dark money. When we contacted his campaign, it released a statement from McCready saying he believes that 'money is corrupting our politics and that we've got to take on special interests and the status quo, which is why if elected to Congress I will advocate for the mandatory disclosure of all donors to dark money groups.' 'Federal election law expressly prohibits candidates from coordinating with a political nonprofit on its independent expenditure spending, and the McCready campaign fully complied with the law,' Amanda Sherman, a spokesperson for McCready's campaign, said in an email. Sherman also said McCready has been endorsed by End Citizens United, a group dedicated to reversing the Supreme Court decision that allowed dark money groups to grow in influence, Citizens United v. FEC. So, we decided to investigate further. It turns out McCready indeed got support from a dark money group. As for the connection to Pelosi, the truth is a little more complicated. WHAT IS DARK MONEY? The Center for Responsive Politics defines dark money as 'political spending meant to influence the decision of a voter, where the donor is not disclosed and the source of the money is unknown.' Dark money groups are usually either political nonprofits that are not required to disclose their donors or super PACs, which are allowed to accept unlimited donations from political nonprofits and other corporations that may or may not have disclosed their donors. Dark money organizations exist on both sides of the political spectrum -- some examples of 501(c) political nonprofits are Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association. 'If you look at the overall amount spent on elections, (dark money) is a relatively small part, but when you look at the most contested races, it's when you see dark money playing a big role,' Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said. 'Dark money and outside money, generally, tend to gravitate towards the most competitive races.' McCready's 2018 congressional race against Republican Mark Harris was one of those tight elections that drew outside spending. DID MCCREADY GET SUPPORT FROM DARK MONEY? Patriot Majority USA is a lesser known, liberal-leaning dark money nonprofit. We found that, as Bishop said, the group supported McCready in 2018. Patriot Majority spent $944,060 against Harris. However, Patriot Majority did not send money directly to McCready's campaign. Instead, it ran TV ads attacking Harris' campaign for being 'out of step' with North Carolina families and alleging that Harris wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare. The ads did not say anything about McCready. Anna Massoglia, a researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics who specializes in dark money, said this is a common tactic used by these organizations. 'In many cases, the spending that we do see on political ads by dark money is more common actually against a candidate than in support of one,' Massoglia said. '...They aren't necessarily 'using' dark money, I wouldn't use that term. I would say that they benefit from dark money whether they like it or not.' If a dark money organization decides to use their money against a candidate, there is really not much a campaign can do, said Robin Kolodny, a professor of political science at Temple University who specializes in political consultants and campaign finances. '(Patriot Majority USA) is entirely independent of the campaign and there is nothing either candidate could do to stop the spending even if they wanted to,' Kolodny said. 'The Supreme Court has held time and again that people may exercise their free speech in whatever amounts they wish.' IS PATRIOT MAJORITY USA ALIGNED WITH NANCY PELOSI? The claim that McCready is in cahoots with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was actually the subject of another fact-check by PolitiFact, based on a claim made by Harris in 2018 that was found Half True. 'It's certainly true that Patriot Majority is a dark money group, and that they support Democrats, and that they're aligned with Democrats,' Fischer said. 'I don't know if that's enough to say that they're specifically aligned with Nancy Pelosi, unless they're using Nancy Pelosi as a stand-in for all Democrats.' While we know that Patriot Majority USA spent almost all of its money in support of Democratic House candidates, we couldn't find a record of Patriot Majority USA being connected to Pelosi. The McCready campaign also received support from the House Majority PAC - a super PAC that is not considered dark money because it discloses its sponsors, according to Massoglia. House Majority PAC is known to be aligned with Pelosi. She raised money for it in 2011, when it first started. In 2018, the House Majority PAC spent $340,018 against Harris, benefiting McCready. OUR RULING Bishop is correct that McCready received support from a dark money group. The McCready campaign did not take money from the group and cannot control the independent expenditures of outside organizations, but that doesn't change the fact that the campaign benefited. While we know that Patriot Majority USA is aligned with the Democratic Party and spent most of its money on House Democrats, we didn't find evidence that Pelosi is aligned with Patriot Majority USA.

20302,8674,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/boy-scouts-condoms-jamboree/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"The late 2017 decision to allow girls into the Boy Scouts of America caused considerable outrage in certain circles, as some argued that the change would lead to the organization's downfall. In May 2018, as BSA eyed a name change, blogs such as DailyWire.com took advantage of the controversy by publishing articles connecting the change to a policy requiring condoms to be available at the World Scout Jamboree: The Boy Scouts World Scout Jamboree, which is held every four years and next will be held in West Virginia in 2019, may offer something to Scouts that would have been unthinkable years ago: condoms. A WND.com article had similarly misleading paragraphs: The Boy Scouts have decided to accept people who identify as gay and lesbian among their ranks. And girls are welcome now, too, into the iconic organization, which has renamed itself Scouts BSA. So what's next? A mandate that condoms be made available to 'all participants' of its global gathering. These articles heavily implied that the condom policy was new, and that it was directly connected to the decision to allow girls into BSA: At best this is misleading, as the policy requiring condoms to be available at the World Scout Jamboree comes from the World Organization of the Scout Movement, not BSA. WOSM is an international scouting organization that oversees a regular Jamboree (usually every four years) attended by scouts from all over the world. In guidelines for the event adopted in March 2016, the WSOM said: The host organization must ensure that condoms are readily and easily accessible for all participants and IST at a number of locations on the site. Heads of Contingent must be informed in advance and made aware of their responsibility in communicating this policy to their Participants, Unite Leaders Contingent Staff, and IST in an appropriate way. When making this information available onsite, consideration shall be given to the various cultures and beliefs present. The 2019 Jamboree will be far from the first time condoms have been made available at the event. A 2011 handbook for an event in Sweden encouraged safe sex and noted the availability of condoms at the health center: It is important to always take care of yourself and others. Sex without a condom or other form of contraception can result in pregnancy, and if your partner has HIV or a sexually transmitted infection (and you might not always know they do), you can become infected too. About sex and relationships If you are considering having sex, condoms are the best way to protect yourself against infections and pregnancy. These are available from the Health Centres or can be purchased from the pharmacy on Four Seasons Square. An article from BBC also reported that condoms would be made available to attendees of the 20th World Scout Jamboree in Thailand in 2002. (Some outlets at the time expressed outrage about the availability of condoms and warned about a Boy Scout 'orgy.') According to a 2006 report, condoms have been made available at international scouting events at least 1992: For nearly 15 years the policy of the World Organization of the Scout Movement - which is the authority responsible for the World Scout Jamboree - has been to hand out free condoms in the health centres set up for the event, to all participants that may request them. The fight against AIDS and the resurgence of sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs) prompted WOSM to work closely with UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA to set up educational programmes that, on the one hand, contribute to the emotional and sexual education of young people by integrating the emotional development of young people - whether boys or girls - and, on the other hand, through the prevention of risks linked to sexually transmitted illnesses (see story). The presence of the Scout Movement in many countries affected by STIs has naturally led national Scout organisations to include this problem into their educational programmes. WSOM officially implemented a policy requiring condoms to be available at the World Scout Jamboree in 2002, releasing a statement about it at the time: It is the policy of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, which is the authority responsible for the World Scout Jamboree, to have condoms freely available in each health centre of the event for any participant that makes this request. The spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has led the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) to coordinate with UNAIDS, UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the UNFPA to create educational programmes for the emotional and sexual education of young people. These programmes integrate both the emotional development of youth, boys and girls, and the prevention of risks related to sexually transmitted infections. The presence of Scouting in a number of countries particularly affected by STIs has led these National Scout Organizations to include this issue in their educational programmes as well. We reached out to WSOM about the articles attempting to connect the decades old policy to the Boy Scouts of American recent decision to include girls and were told that these two decisions were in no way related. WSOM also clarified that condoms are not 'distributed directly to participants' but are available at the health center: WOSM is committed to offer a safe space for all participants during World Scout Events. While condoms are not distributed directly to participants at activities during World Scout Jamboree, condoms are still made available as part of the youth-friendly services offered at the health centre and in line with the international best practices recommended by the United Nations. WOSM advises at the beginning of the event the organisers and delegation leaders of all health services provided to participants at the centre. In accordance with WOSM's guidelines and in line with the best international health practices as recommended by the United Nations specialised agencies, WOSM makes condoms available in each health centre of the event for any participant that makes this request. The policy on condoms started in 2002 and is not connected to the Boy Scouts of America's decision to open all its educational programmes to young women. Vice Chairperson of the World Scout Committee Andy Chapman confirmed to us that WSOM sets the guidelines for the Jamboree, and that the three host organizations of this year's event -Scouts Canada, the Scout Association of Mexico, and the Boy Scouts of America - are working to implement the requirements in an appropriate manner. Chapman also noted that the WSOM policies take into account the concerns of a variety of countries, not just the United States: Planning for the 2019 World Scout Jamboree is currently underway between the World Organization of Scout Movement (WOSM) and the three National Scout Organizations who are co-hosting the event - Scouts Canada, the Scout Association of Mexico and the Boy Scouts of America. 'The World Scout Jamboree is an official program of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. As a world Scouting event, WOSM previously established the requirements and guidelines for the 2019 World Scout Jamboree. The co-hosts are working with WOSM to appropriately implement these requirements. The World Scout Jamboree organizing team has worked with the co-host countries to align these requirements, which have been in place for the past two World Scout Jamborees, in a manner that is respectful to local laws and preferences. For instance, alcohol will not be offered at the 2019 World Scout Jamboree at the Summit Bechtel Reserve. The 2019 World Scout Jamboree will focus Scouts from around the world on personal development, faith and beliefs, sustainability, adventure and other topics that cross cultural lines. Scouting's founder Lord Baden-Powell of Great Britain believed that bringing youth of the world together would help foster greater cultural awareness, acceptance and cooperation. The 2019 World Scout Jamboree is being planned with this spirit in mind. The articles insinuating that the condom policy was new and somehow connected to Boy Scouts of America's decision to welcome girls into the organization were ignoring the fact that girls already make up a large portion of the global scouting community, and that they have for years been allowed to join the Scouts in a majority of countries (emphasis ours): So, obvious question, but will there be girls at the 2019 World Scout Jamboree? This is still a great question to ask because not only will there be girls at the 2019 WSJ, they will make up about half of all participants attending! In recent years, more girls than boys have joined Scouting globally. If you are curious about how co-ed Scouting works, you have to see how the rest of the world does it. Of the 169 members of the World Organization of the Scouting Movement (WOSM), only fourteen countries have specifically boys-only Scouting. So that means that our co-hosts, Canada and Mexico, will be bringing tons of young women to the 2019 WSJ. Not to mention, almost every other nation across the globe will be joining them! In fact, a group of girls were in attendance at the first World Scout Jamboree in London in 1920. The WSOM has officially accepted female members since the early 1970s, and the majority of scouting programs welcome both boys and girls: This is definitely not the first time that girls will be attending the World Scout Jamboree. A patrol of girls was present at the 1st World Scout Jamboree that was held in London in 1920. In response, the Girl Guide Movement was established by Lord Baden-Powell as a 'sister organisation' to Scouting. WOSM itself is made up of 169 National Scout Organizations, and has formally accepted female members since the early 1970s. The majority of these organisations now offer Scouting programmes that welcome both boys and girls, young men and young women. In other words, 2018 headlines about condoms being the latest symptom of scouting decline are little more than warmed-over outrage clickbait.Recent Updates Clarification [23 May 2018]: A previous version of this article said that WSOM's policy to provide condoms at the World Scout Jamboree was implemented in the 1990s. Although condoms were provided at events during this time, the official policy was not implemented until 2002. ",Did the Boy Scouts of America Implement a New Policy Requiring Condoms to Be Available at Jamboree? The policy has been in place for years and is not connected to BSA's decision to include girls.

The majority of Minecraft mods are non-sexual in nature, and parents concerned about their children being exposed to 'sex mods' are likely better served by restricting their YouTube access than by taking the game away from them.","On 21 October 2016 a parenting blog published an editorial penned by a guilt-ridden mother about her purported discovery of 'sex mods' for the massively popular Minecraft sandbox video game: Take a minute to Google 'Minecraft + sex mod.' I'll wait ... not only did my brain explode, but my heart did as well. Unfortunately, it was my kid who filled me in ... I suddenly found myself looking into the tearful eyes of one of my babies who was telling me that, not only was this kid playing Minecraft when she saw this, but she was also propositioned in this 'creative mode' room by another player ... This child was crushed. She opened up, and told me about the things that appear in apps. She shared a lot about how she was feeling as a result of this experience that made me want to weep and weep. The virtual world is so real to our kids. She felt like it had actually happened to her in real life. It could not be shrugged off. She actually wanted me to take away her phone, the portal to this hurt. There were many tears, half of them from me. All I could do was apologize for not protecting her better. Because the truth is, it's all my fault. I thought I was doing my due diligence in the technology department. We pay attention to how much time they spend online and limit it as well, even detoxing completely from time to time. We keep the apps they used restricted to the 10 and under age range, and Minecraft falls into this category. And still this happened. Because, sadly where the kids are, the creepers will follow. (Minecraft pun intended.) And the creepers found my baby. The post rattled off purported 'stranger danger' statistics unrelated to Minecraft or 'sex mods' and advised parents to take the standard steps of 'locking down' and/or monitoring their children's Internet time. (Tips of that sort are standard advice given to parents about Internet safety and have nothing to do with Minecraft specifically.) The mother in question stated she 'did a little research,' but that research didn't pertain to the existence of Minecraft sex mods. The popular parenting blog Scary Mommy tackled the topic on 24 October 2016, also presenting information largely unrelated to the functions of Minecraft: After I dropped my kids off at school, I took a deep breath and googled 'minecraft sex mods.' And fuck. Fuckity fuck fuck. A ton of hits come up, mostly YouTube videos. Apparently, in the app version of the game, there is a way to 'craft' such cringe-worthy things as pixelated characters getting it on with each other. I could only bring myself to watch a few of the videos. (OK, just one.) I couldn't get past the 'gangsta' Minecraft dude banging a bikini-clad chick in the back room of a Minecraft whorehouse. (Yes, really.) I'll spare you the rest because I'm a decent human being. At first, I was just happy that my 9-year-old, a Minecraft aficionado for many years, doesn't use the app version of the game. But then I realized, duh, the kid spends a million hours watching Minecraft YouTube videos. The Scary Mommy writer similarly reported that she engaged in some 'research,' which appeared to consist of viewing YouTube videos about (but not hosted by or affiliated with Minecraft). The writer was appalled that some of the videos were not age-protected, although since those videos are not official Minecraft media, responsibility for their policing rests with YouTube. Few things in 2016 have captivated children like Minecraft (software lauded for its ability to operate as a covert educational platform), and few things have terrified parents more than 'sex perverts on the Internet.' Moreover, Minecraft's popularity with children is often matched only by their parents' lack of understanding of the game. The confluence of these circumstances means that if a Minecraft rumor about sexual predators were to spread unchecked, children could be deprived of one of the most enjoyable learning experiences available to them. Neither of the articles referenced above explained what a Minecraft 'sex mod' might be, nor how the process of modifying Minecraft works. We contacted both Minecraft maker Mojang as well as Bec Oakley, the owner of a popular Minecraft web guide for parents called MineMum. Mojang did not respond to our inquiry, but Oakley was aware of the viral rumors and explained how mods work for Minecraft players: Here's the deal. Mods are bits of unofficial modified game code that users can create that add items to the game or change the things that a player can do. They are then made available for anyone to download in user forums and gamer websites. They're not an official part of the game, are not supported by Mojang (the makers of Minecraft), don't come packaged with the game and must be added voluntarily and manually. There are thousands and thousands of these mods around, most of which are not inappropriate. But given that it is user-generated content that is not under any kind of controls or censorship, there are inappropriate mods available (there are also other types of modified content like skins and texture packs). These have been in existence for a long time, and probably since Minecraft was first released years ago. On YouTube there are thousands of videos of players playing modded games of Minecraft, and some of these involve players playing with a sex mod applied to the game. Usually these videos are age restricted but there are ones that slip through the YouTube age protection cracks. There is no sex level in the official game of Minecraft. There is no sexual content in the official game of Minecraft. Mods are not supported or endorsed by Mojang. Mods cannot be added to the game automatically. There are mods that contain content considered inappropriate for children. Mods can be downloaded and applied to the game by any player who has access to the internet and knows how to google for 'minecraft mods'. There are no ratings or censorship controls for mods. There are YouTube videos of users playing Minecraft with inappropriate mods. We asked Oakley whether it was possible for players to encounter Minecraft sex mods without having gone through the lengthy process of specifically installing those mods themselves. Surmising that YouTube videos (not Minecraft content) was responsible for web-wide parental alarm, she responded: No you can't encounter a sex mod in the game (or any mod) without having installed it. Kids aren't going to accidentally come across this mod without someone having installed it - either in their own game or on a multiplayer server that they're playing on. You can encounter YouTube videos of people playing with sex mods installed, I think that's a large part of where parents are freaking out. In short, the Minecraft 'sex mod' frenzy is likely borne of a combination of fears about Internet predators, ignorance of the manner in which Minecraft works, and the universal popularity of articles warning that a common and popular children's pastime harbors a hidden danger. There are no 'sex mods' or 'sex levels' in the official Minecraft game, and such mods can only be accessed after an intentional installation of them or on a multiplayer server.

A litany of explanations were floated by the Trump campaign, its surrogates, and the media for two days after the controversial incident. But on 20 July 2016, the Trump campaign released a letter [PDF] that initially prompted more questions than answers, attributing the error to Trump speechwriter/ghostwriter Meredith McIver and asserting that McIver had tendered her resignation (which was summarily rejected by Donald Trump): Meredith McIver offered resignation over Melania speech. Statement and letter -> pic.twitter.com/qfVPsTuN19 - Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) July 20, 2016 In a year of what felt like increasingly implausible news, Melania Trump's controversy and the involvement of Meredith McIver in it was just another bizarre twist to many social media users and journalists. No one could recall having previously heard of Meredith McIver even though many of the campaign's operatives were well known to the news media, making the public suspicious that Melania's 'speechwriter' was another 'John Barron.' (Barron was one of two pseudonyms used by Trump himself to interact with the media earlier in his career.) Entire articles pointed out seeming 'holes' in the putative existence of the Meredith McIver 'character': McIver's Facebook page is only a day old as well and she has no friends. One would hope that as a 'long-time employee' she would have made at least a few friends in the Trump organization. McIver has a page at Speakerpedia, but strangely there are only two reviews, both of which came over the past two days. And the page has yet to be claimed by Ms. McIver. McIver does have an author page on Amazon.com, but there's no photo, or any writing credits outside of work done for Trump. Her Twitter identity is a little shaky as well. A Google search restricted to a few months prior to July 2016 was populated with references to McIver as a Trump employee, primarily with respect to her co-authorship of Trump books. And in 2007 the Guardian published a piece (which has not since been edited to include a reference to McIver) in which the elusive writer made a brief appearance in an article about Donald Trump: Time being money, Trump springs up to hand me some propaganda: glossy brochures featuring Trump Towers, Trump Palaces, Trump Plazas, Trump Hotels and Trump Golf Clubs all over North America - correction, the World. 'I'll get you a biography, too.' Well, I mutter, I've read several of your autobiographies and ... 'This'll be a little easier for you. MEREDITH!' Trump has what some of his employees refer to as an open-door policy; its main function seems to be that he can shout at them through it. 'Would you get me a biography please!' Meredith McIver, one of the assistants who doubles as his ghost writer, scuttles in with a few sheets of paper, on which a company bio is printed in bold and written in similar fashion: 'A schoolboy's dream ... a competitor's challenge. Donald J Trump is the very definition of the American success story. In August 2006, Mr Trump was voted by the staff and writers of Business Week as one of the Top 10 most competitive business people on the planet.' McIver was also heard (but not seen) in a 2005 New York Times article about ghostwriters that referenced her (open) co-authorship of that year's Trump book, Think Like a Billionaire: Thus, at the end of 'Think Like a Billionaire,' after Trump has thanked all the pertinent people, McIver thanks her family, her friends, her minions, the Trump Organization and even Tassos of Patmos. If we have reached the point in our history where ghostwriters find it necessary to thank Tassos of Patmos for his contribution to the making of 'Think Like a Billionaire,' I shudder to think what is coming next. Whoever Tassos of Patmos is. Furthermore, Meredith McIver is registered to vote in New York City (but presumably didn't cast a ballot in the state's closed primary for her boss, given that she is registered as a Democrat). While Meredith McIver may have maintained a low profile throughout her years in Trump's employ, she has been spotted by at least one journalist and maintains an active voter registrant. The sudden spotlight shined upon her made her convenient appearance suspicious, but the evidence suggests McIver has been kicking around Trump Tower for quite some time.","Trump Ghostwriter Meredith McIver Doesn't Exist?

Mastoiditis (incorrectly spelled as 'mastioditis' in the user's post) is a rare but serious a bacterial infection of the mastoid bone, which is located behind the ear. In developed countries such as the United States the incidence of mastoiditis is very low (about 0.004%), and the infection usually stems from an untreated or aggressive ear infection.Although mastoiditis is fairly rare today, that bacterial infection was once a leading cause of childhood mortality. When ear infections are untreated or partially treated, or sometimes when an antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria is the cause of the infection, mastoiditis can occur:[M]astoiditis often develops as a result of a middle ear infection. Bacteria from the middle ear can travel into the air cells of the mastoid bone. In addition, a skin cyst (cholesteatoma) in the middle ear may block drainage of the ear, leading to mastoiditis.The photograph appended to the Facebook post explained that the pictured child's hospital treatment included an incision to drain accumulated fluid behind his ear. However, some readers were confused by this and believed that mastoiditis itself caused the wound. In cases where mastoiditis has developed, the area (prior to treatment) would appear raised but not commonly broken:Much of what the Facebook user stated about mastoiditis was essentially true: While mastoiditis is increasingly rare due to the advent of antibiotics, the condition requires prompt treatment and can rapidly become a serious medical issue:Acute mastoiditis (AM) is an infectious disease of the temporal bone that can complicate acute otitis media (AOM). The incidence of AM in children younger than 14 years is estimated to be 1.2 to 4.2 per year in developed countries. Despite modern antibiotherapy, AM may develop quickly and become life threatening, with extracranial and intracranial complications. Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of AM. In this case, most children undergo mastoidectomy, a strategy to restore healthy microglial function and prevent progression to AD.Mastoiditis can be difficult to treat, but it can also usually be prevented.

22682,11693,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/planned-parenthood-prenatal-care/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 24 January 2017, the Facebook page 'Live Action' published a video purportedly showing 'Prenatal Care Deception' at Planned Parenthood, which has approximately 650 health centers operated by 57 affiliates across the U.S. The gist of the video's presentation was that Planned Parenthood lies about providing reproductive and health services such as prenatal care, instead focusing solely on providing abortions: The majority of the above-displayed video centered on alleged audio recordings of telephone calls to Planned Parenthood centers asking about prenatal services. These calls were framed by two misleading and out-of-context quotes from Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards present in an attempt to make it seem as if her organization was falsely touting the number of prenatal care services they provide. This video quotes snippets of Richards' saying: 'Prenatal care. These are the kinds of services that folks depend on Planned Parenthood for,' and 'a president who will fight for pre-natal care!' We could not find the specific origins of the first snippet, but it's clear that Richards was listing several services that Planned Parenthood provides (and not claiming they offer only or primarily prenatal care), as she said 'these are the kinds of services that folks depend on planned Parenthood for. But Live Action apparently omitted the first portion of her statement. The second snippet came from a 2016 speech in which Richards endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. The portion of the speech included in the Live Action video was less about what services Planned Parenthood offers and more about what qualities the organization was looking for in a U.S. president: They want a president who believes access to health care isn't a luxury - it's a human right. They want a president who understands that being pro-choice also means being able to choose to have a child - and a president who will fight for prenatal care, head start, health care for kids and first class public schools because it takes a village! They want a president who will stand up to the gun lobby and demand safety for kids in schools, folks in church, and women getting healthcare - no matter what. They want a president who will demand nobody is paid less just because they are a woman - we deserve 100 cents on the dollar! They want a president who believes that access to health care isn't a luxury it's a human right. They also want a president who understands that being pro-choice actually means being able to choose to have a child. And a president who will fight for pre-natal care, and head start, and health care for kids, and excellent public education. Because as someone so famously said, it takes a village to raise a child. The video also used a quote from Lori Lamerand, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan, to make it seem as if the organization were unjustly touting their prenatal care services. According to the video, Lamerand said: 'Prenatal care! Um - and that - that is what we want to focus on. That is what is so vital.' But again, this quote was taken out of context from a speech Lamerand gave during the Pink Bus Tour in 2011, and according to Planned Parenthood, Lamerand 'spoke about the vital services like birth control, pap smears, and preventative cancer screenings, which Planned Parenthood provides to women who otherwise might go without.' The context of these quotes is important since Live Action shared this video with the title 'the Prenatal Care Deception.' In order to set up the 'deception,' Live Action needed to try to establish that Planned Parenthood supposedly unjustly bragged about the prominence of their prenatal care services before offering supposed audio recordings of calls with Planned Parenthood representatives who stated that the organization did not in fact provide these services. Although Planned Parenthood does provide prenatal care services, those services are not a primary part of their operation. According to organization's annual report for 2014-2015, they only provided 17,419 instances of prenatal care services (compared to 3,533,522 STD tests and 323,999 abortions.) Live Action offered no evidence that Planned Parenthood lied about these numbers, or that Planned Parenthood claimed they provide prenatal care services at all of their health centers. Not only did Live Action present Planned Parenthood's comments without proper context, their investigation also presented a misleading picture about the services provided by the organization. We can't verify if every one of the phone call recordings offered in the above-displayed video was genuine, but we can say that the claim 'only 5 [Planned Parenthood] facilities out of 97' provide prenatal care is misleading at best. First of all, Planned Parenthood operates more than 650 facilities in the United States. In California alone, we found 13 Planned Parenthood clinics that advertise prenatal services. Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic (PPHP), which operates health centers in Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland counties, New York, provides prenatal care in 6 of their 10 health centers. We also found that many of the Planned Parenthood clinics that do not provide prenatal care services do nonetheless state they offer resources to assist those in need of finding such care: 'If you choose to continue a pregnancy, we will provide you with a list of resources to help you obtain prenatal care.' (We also surveyed several Planned Parenthood offices ourselves. For example, we called the Family First Health Center in Fresno, California, who confirmed to us that they do in fact offer prenatal care services. We also contacted the Planned Parenthood office in Tempe, Arizona (one of the first locations mentioned in the video), who told us that they did not provide prenatal care services themselves but directed us to a nearby facility, the Mountain Park Health Center, that does.) The Live Action video is based on the implication that Planned Parenthood claimed to provide prenatal care services at all of their facilities, or that the organization was misleading the public about how often it provides these services. However, that simply isn't the case: Mary Alice Carter, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, pointed out the group's history of being targeted with selectively edited videos, and said that the new video tried to hold the organization to a standard it had not set for itself. 'It is safe to say that not every single one of our health centers provides prenatal care, and we've never said otherwise,' Ms. Carter said. According to an annual report published in 2015, the most recent period for which information was available, eight Planned Parenthood affiliates of the 59 that existed at the time reported that they had provided 17,419 individual prenatal services. Ms. Carter said that '100 percent' of the organization's health centers would provide what would be considered an initial prenatal visit, which would include a referral for further prenatal services that would be available elsewhere. It should be noted that the organization's web site states that 'Planned Parenthood health centers focus on prevention: 80 percent of our patients receive services to prevent unintended pregnancy,' and that Live Action chose to compare prenatal services (approximately 17,000 in 2014-2015) to abortions (more than 300,000) for this video, which gave the misleading impression that Planned Parenthood rarely provides reproductive health services other than abortions. In reality, Planned Parenthood provides more STD screenings (4,218,149), contraception services (2,945,059), and cancer screenings (682,208) than they do abortions.","Does Planned Parenthood Provide No Prenatal Care, Only Abortions?

That account does have some elements of truth to it, but although actor Lee Marvin was a guest on that late-night talk show at least seven times during Carson's tenure as host, most of what is included in that account is outright fiction or a transcript based on someone's badly flawed memory: Dialog from a Tonight Show ...

You and the world know him as Captain Kangaroo.' Many people have always been a bit offended that Lee Marvin is buried in a grove of 3 and 4 star generals at Arlington. His marker gives his name, rank (PVT) and service (USMC). Nothing else. I thought to myself, damn here's a guy who was only a famous movie star who served his time, why the heck does he rate burial with these guys? Well, following is the amazing answer: I always liked Lee Marvin, but did not know the extent of his Corps experiences. Including award of the Navy Cross. There is only one higher award...the Medal Of Honor. Lee Marvin did enlist in the U.S. Marines, saw action as Private First Class in the Pacific during World War II, and was wounded (in the buttocks) by fire which severed his sciatic nerve. However, his injury occurred during the battle for Saipan in June 1944, not the battle for Iwo Jima, which took place several months later, in February 1945. Marvin also received a Purple Heart and was indeed interred at Arlington National Cemetery (but he was not, as some versions of this piece claim, awarded a Navy Cross). Bob Keeshan, later famous as television's 'Captain Kangaroo,' also enlisted in the U.S. Marines, but he did so too late to see any action during World War II. Keeshan was born on 27 June 1927 and enlisted two weeks before his 18th birthday, several months after the fighting at Iwo Jima. In a 1997 interview, Keeshan explained that he 'enlisted in the U.S. Marines but saw no combat' because he signed up 'just before we dropped the atom bomb.' Military officials have also disclaimed the exaggerated accounts presented in the Internet-circulated versions of the two actors' military exploits: Jack Green, the public-affairs officer with the Naval Historical Center in Washington, frequently gets calls about Fighting Captain Kangaroo. 'I have to tell them it's a nice story, but it didn't happen,' said Green, who served as a historical adviser for the movie Pearl Harbor. He doubts that Marvin, who also never was on Iwo Jima, perpetrated such a fantasy. 'Lots of legends pop up and who knows where they come from,' Green said. In 2003 someone thought to throw children's television host Fred Rogers into the mix by add the following bit to the existing e-mail about Lee Marvin and Bob Keeshan: On another note, there was this wimpy little man (who just passed away) on PBS, gentle and quiet. Mr. Rogers is another of those you would least suspect of being anything but what he now portrays to our youth. But Mr. Rogers was a U.S. Navy Seal, combat proven in Vietnam with over twenty-five confirmed kills to his name. He wore a long sleeve sweater to cover the many tattoo's on his forearm and biceps. A master in small arms and hand-to-hand combat, able to disarm or kill in a heartbeat. He hid that away and won our hearts with his quiet wit and charm. America's real heroes don't flaunt what they did, they quietly go about their day to day lives, doing what they do best. They earned our respect and the freedoms that we all enjoy. Look around and see if you can find one of those heroes in your midst. Often, they are the ones you'd least suspect, but would most like to have on your side if anything ever happened. Numerous rumors about children's television host Fred Rogers having a violent, criminal, or military background have been bandied about for years, but there is nothing to any of them. As our Mr. Rogers page explains, Fred Rogers never served in the military.","Did Captain Kangaroo and Lee Marvin Fight at Iwo Jima?

On April 11, 2021, Twitter account @TheJokerMouce posted a video compilation showing, in three separate clips, individuals being vaccinated by members of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department - a special-needs woman, a special-needs girl, and an older resident of a nursing home. 'They're going after the mentally disabled/housebound,' the account asserted, 'Gee, this reminds me of... the way Nazi's [sic] started with the mentally disabled.' The tweet was aggressively promoted by several dubious sources including America's Frontline Doctors - a right-wing political group that promoted hydroxychloroquine early in the COVID-19 pandemic whose membership includes at least one doctor who believes in demon semen - and conspiratorial media outlets like NWO Report. On April 12, 2021, both outlets or organizations ran stories based on this tweet with the headlines, 'LAPD police force-vaccinate special-needs girls in statewide 'Operation Homebound' program' and 'Cops Force-Vaccinate Special Needs Girls In Statewide 'Operation Homebound' Program,' respectively. The latter made these false or misleading assertions of the video: After forcibly injecting her with the experimental mRNA vaccine, the officers then clapped as the woman continued wailing. Another special needs girl is seen in a driveway trying to escape the officers with the vaccine before also getting jabbed. Next, the officers appeared to administer the COVID-19 to a sleeping patient with Alzheimer's disease without her knowledge or consent. The video appears to exploit for political purposes individuals with developmental disabilities who are scared of needles or individuals whose advanced age makes them appear frail in order to give the impression they are receiving vaccines without being granted proper consent. However, these individual's parents, legal guardians, or other legal representatives accepted vaccination on their behalf. As described by the California Department of Developmental Services, consent can be given by 'Parents or legal guardians of minor children, people allowed under a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, conservators of adults' and in some cases the executive director of a regional care center 'when the person is unable to and no one else can.' The involvement of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) stems from an initiative named Operation Homebound. The goal of the program, as described by the LASD, is 'to vaccinate the most underrepresented, homebound, and underserved disabled residents in our communities, including those experiencing homelessness.' It is not true, as claimed in viral reports, that mRNA vaccines are shown in these videos. Operation Homebound utilized the non-mRNA Johnson & Johnson vaccine. As a result of the April 2021 Food and Drug Administration pause on that vaccine, Operation Homebound is presently paused as well. Under the program, 'deputy sheriff personnel who are certified paramedics and emergency medical technicians' have administered shots in partnership with the disability advocacy groups Integrated Community Collaborative and Disability Voices United. These groups help identify vulnerable populations and help the LASD in their interactions with the patients and their families. As Lt. Sue Burakowski of the LASD explained to the Antelope Valley Press, getting vaccinated can be a scary experience for individuals with special needs. 'It's a traumatic experience, you know, and it takes the whole family to convince them to get the shots,' she said. Fernando Gomez, co-founder of Integrated Community Collaborative, explained that 'We're there to help LASD in that interaction with the families.' Snopes reached out to the LASD to ask about the context behind these videos and the assertion that they show state-mandated forced vaccination. By email, LASD Captain John Satterfield of the Sheriff's Information Bureau told us: Vaccines were not 'forced' on anyone and each recipient provided signed informed consent, or signed informed consent was provided by their legal guardian in cases where developmental disability legally prevented the ability of the individual to provide informed consent. The context left out of these ridiculous claims and allegations would be the unquestionable thanks and appreciation we have received from the families of each and every individual, thanking us for bringing this life saving vaccine to their home and providing it to their loved ones at no cost or inconvenience. It is a shame those who wish to make political statements by providing misinformation have chosen to disparage the good works being done with 'Operation Homebound.' Because these videos show vaccines being administered to people with special needs through a voluntary public health program with the legal consent of family members or guardians, the claim that the LASD is 'force-vaccinating' is 'False.'",Is LA Sheriff's Dept.

In August 2021, as a new wave of COVID-19 cases rose in Kentucky, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul urged Americans to resist mask mandates and other guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) related to stopping the now nearly two-year pandemic in a video posted to his Twitter account. Paul captioned his video: We are at a moment of truth and a crossroads. Will we allow these people to use fear and propaganda to do further harm to our society, economy, and children? Or will we stand together and say, absolutely not. Not this time. I choose freedom. As this video went viral, many Twitter users responded by posting a photograph of Paul that supposedly showed him receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. This photograph was frequently shared with captions claiming that Paul was a hypocrite, as he was urging others to 'resist' the CDC while the picture supposedly showed him receiving a vaccine urged by the CDC. This is a genuine photograph of Paul receiving a vaccine. However, it is not recent and does not show him getting a COVID-19 vaccination. The picture was taken in 2015, and shows Paul receiving a booster vaccination for Hepatitis A from a physician at the U.S. Capitol. You can read more about the benefits of a Hepatitis A vaccine on this page from the CDC. The New York Times reports that Paul received this vaccine shortly after he set off an 'uproar' when he seemingly made anti-vaccination comments amidst a measles outbreak. The following day, the Kentucky senator invited a New York Times reporter to go along with him as he received a vaccination. From the NY Times: On Tuesday, Mr. Paul sought to clarify those comments, inviting a New York Times reporter to accompany him to the Capitol physician's office to watch him receive a hepatitis A booster vaccination. During the visit, Mr. Paul said he believed that the science was definitive on the matter and that vaccines were not harmful. 'It just annoys me that I'm being characterized as someone who's against vaccines,' he said as he rolled up his T-shirt sleeve before the shot. 'That's not what I said. I said I've heard of people who've had vaccines, and they see a temporal association and they believe that.' As for the COVID-19 vaccinations, it doesn't appear that Paul ever received his vaccine. The senator tested positive for COVID-19 back in March 2020. Paul survived the ordeal and appears to have been largely asymptomatic. Afterward, Paul claimed that since he had COVID-19, there was no need for him to get the vaccine. This claim - that natural immunity provides better protection than vaccines - is disputed by the science. On Aug. 6, 2021, the American Hospitals Association publicized two recent studies from the CDC that showed those with 'natural immunity' were more than twice as likely to be reinfected than those who had received vaccines. The AHA writes: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today released a study confirming the comparative effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines versus natural immunity, including immunity gained from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Researchers found that, among hundreds of Kentucky residents with previous infections through June 2021, those who were unvaccinated had 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared with those who were fully vaccinated. CDC says the research suggests that among people who have had COVID-19 previously, getting fully vaccinated provides additional protection against reinfection. A second CDC study, published concurrently, shows the extent to which vaccines prevented COVID-19-related hospitalizations among the highest risk age groups.","Did Rand Paul Get COVID-19 Vaccination in Viral Photo?

But sometimes undercover cops can inadvertently put themselves in harm's way by playing their roles too well, as suggested in the following meme: This farce played out on Detroit's east side in November 2017, although it wasn't quite as simple as the above meme, and several news accounts, made it sound. Special-operations officers from Detroit's 11th Precinct were preparing to execute a search warrant on a suspected drug house, but unbeknownst to them, cops from the department's 12th Precinct were operating within the 11th Precinct's territory. This intersection of two different groups of police who had not coordinated with or made their presence known to each other set the stage for chaos. First, two special-ops officials from the 11th Precinct encountered two undercover cops from the 12th Precinct who were posing as drug dealers, and the former attempted to detain the latter. Then, while 11th Precinct officers were executing their search warrant on the suspected drug house, a separate team of cops from the 12th Precinct stormed into the house before it could be secured, triggering a confused brawl between the two groups: The incident occurred on Nov. 9 when two officers from Detroit's 12th Precinct were posing as drug dealers in order to arrest buyers. Two buyers did arrive to the drug house, but they were undercover police officers from Detroit's 11th district. The officers did not know each other. More officers from the 11th district arrived to serve a search warrant and that's 'when it started to go terribly wrong,' [Detroit Police Chief James] Craig said. Body camera footage shows the two groups of police officers yelling, shoving and throwing punches at each other. 'They appeared to be like Keystone cops,' Craig said, referring to the fictional police officers depicted in comedic silent films. Footage from one of the officers' body cameras captured part of the fracas between the two groups of officers: 'This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I've seen in this department since I've been appointed police chief,' James Craig told reporters. 'In fact, I'd have to tell you it is probably one of the most disappointing things I've experienced in my entire 40-year career.' During the botched operation, 12th precinct officers, who were posing as drug dealers, were held at gunpoint by police from the 11th precinct. 'I am thankful that no one was more seriously injured,' Craig said. A video of the incident, which took place on 9 November, has been been released as part of the investigation. The bodycam footage shows one officer shouting: 'Don't put your hand on your gun' while another says his team has a search warrant. As the brawl develops, the bodycam is knocked off the officer filming. It is believed a lack of communication over the existence of the warrant led to the problem. https://globalnews.ca/video/rd/1095738947667/ According to one report, the incident involved two dozen police officers altogether, one of whom was taken to a hospital: After obtaining a search warrant to raid a home in the 19000 block of Andover Street, the undercover unit from the 11th Precinct entered the home, but then a separate team of cops from the 12th Precinct stormed the location before the home could be secured. One officer was taken to the hospital after the incident, according to [WXYZ], which quoted an unidentified cop who said the crew from the 12th Precinct didn't follow proper protocol since it didn't notify the department of the raid, which occurred three blocks inside the 11th Precinct's territory. Officers from the 12th Precinct also didn't properly notify the 11th Precinct during a prostitution sting that led to a police chase, according to the police source. In all, about 24 cops were involved, including some in full tactical gear and armed with assault rifles who were pushing and shoving each other in the 'heated' and 'bruising' incident. Contrary to the wording of the meme presented above, we found nothing documenting that undercover police from the 11th Precinct were 'posing as drug buyers.' A couple of 11th Precinct officers unknowingly encountered undercover cops from the 12th Precinct who were posing as drug dealers and attempted to detain them, but the former were on the scene because they were part of a group of officers attempting to execute a search warrant on a suspected drug house, not because they were engaged in an undercover operation that had them posing as drug buyers.",Did One Group of Undercover Cops Try to Arrest Other Undercover Cops?

Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That's 16 years ago.' Here, we'll focus on the final part of that statement -- that household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. On the numbers, Trump is right. Once you adjust for inflation, median household income fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, the last full year for which data is available. That's a decline of $4,067 -- in line with what Trump said. This chart shows the trend since 2000. However, it's worth noting one bit of context. While this statistic came amid a series of shots at President Barack Obama, the majority of the period Trump was referring to came under the presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican. During the first eight years of the span Trump referred to -- 2000 to 2008 -- Bush was president. And during Bush's tenure, inflation-adjusted median household income declined by $2,411, which is more than half the total amount it fell between 2000 and 2014. Since Obama took office, it has fallen by $1,656. That's not a great legacy, but it's worth remembering that slicing the numbers this way puts all of the Great Recession on Obama's watch while also denying Obama 2015, when there was a slow but steady recovery, because data is not available.",,,,"'Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Here's what Romney said about his work with the Democratic legislature in a speech to a Manchester Rotary club on Aug. 8, 2011. 'We worked together to find a way not to just reduce the rate of growth in spending but to actually cut back on spending in the state budget. And so I was able to do that, and then we worked together in ensuing years to hold down our spending level relative to our revenue level. And that was why at the end of my four-year term, the rainy day fund was established at more than $2 billion.' We wanted to explore whether Romney is right that his bipartisan efforts were so successful. To back up the claim, the Romney campaign pointed us a to series of state financial statements. They show that shortly after he took office in 2003, Romney and the legislature did cut spending for the 2004 budget year by slightly more than 1 percent. However, spending increased in subsequent years. And they also show that when Romney left office in 2007, Massachusetts' Rainy Day Fund did indeed hold more than $2 billion. Massachusetts budget watchers we spoke with don't quarrel with those particulars. They also say it's true that Romney didn't act alone. 'Obviously he did that with the Democratic legislature.' said Geoff Beckwith, director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that represents local governments in the state. Michael Widmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a non-partisan fiscal policy group, presented a less-rosy picture of bipartisan cooperation but acknowledged the results. 'Romney presented budgets and the legislature rewrote his budgets, and then he'd veto a few things, and then they'd override his vetoes.' The analysts agree that Romney's account of his fiscal record is largely accurate but doesn't tell the whole story. Widmer notes that aside from 2003, when Romney and lawmakers took emergency action to cut state aid to cities and towns, spending under Romney rose every year, often far faster than the rate of inflation. The state also received more revenue after the legislature and Romney made adjustments to state fees and taxes. Romney's campaign has characterized them as 'closing loopholes' or increases for a specific purpose, such as transportation. Others, however, describe them as tax hikes. 'There were no broad-based tax increases,' said Widmer, 'but part of the revenue growth was corporate tax increases and fee increases.' The growth of the nation's economy also played a significant role. Romney came into office during a downturn, but for much of his term his term, the stock market boomed. Collections from Massachusetts' capital gains tax on Romney's watch outstripped estimates by $1.3 billion. 'That's where most of the growth in the rainy day fund came from. It wasn't part of some sort of concerted effort to hold down spending beyond what the estimates were,' said Beckwith. Added Widmer, 'All of these numbers are in the context of national forces that he as governor had very little to do with or any other governor.' Our Ruling: Mitt Romney said he worked with Democrats to leave behind a rainy day fund that topped $2 billion. The state's financial records back that up. But it's important to note that the spending reductions he touts occurred in just one year, 2003. Other years, thanks to economic growth, Romney and the legislature were able to increase spending. And besides the spending reductions in that one year, Massachusetts also earned a revenue windfall from a surge in capital gains receipts. We rate his claim Mostly True.

'Obviously he did that with the Democratic legislature.' said Geoff Beckwith, director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that represents local governments in the state. Michael Widmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a non-partisan fiscal policy group, presented a less-rosy picture of bipartisan cooperation but acknowledged the results. 'Romney presented budgets and the legislature rewrote his budgets, and then he'd veto a few things, and then they'd override his vetoes.' The analysts agree that Romney's account of his fiscal record is largely accurate but doesn't tell the whole story. Widmer notes that aside from 2003, when Romney and lawmakers took emergency action to cut state aid to cities and towns, spending under Romney rose every year, often far faster than the rate of inflation. The state also received more revenue after the legislature and Romney made adjustments to state fees and taxes. Romney's campaign has characterized them as 'closing loopholes' or increases for a specific purpose, such as transportation. Others, however, describe them as tax hikes. 'There were no broad-based tax increases,' said Widmer, 'but part of the revenue growth was corporate tax increases and fee increases.' The growth of the nation's economy also played a significant role. Romney came into office during a downturn, but for much of his term his term, the stock market boomed. Collections from Massachusetts' capital gains tax on Romney's watch outstripped estimates by $1.3 billion. 'That's where most of the growth in the rainy day fund came from. It wasn't part of some sort of concerted effort to hold down spending beyond what the estimates were,' said Beckwith. Added Widmer, 'All of these numbers are in the context of national forces that he as governor had very little to do with or any other governor.' Our Ruling: Mitt Romney said he worked with Democrats to leave behind a rainy day fund that topped $2 billion. The state's financial records back that up. But it's important to note that the spending reductions he touts occurred in just one year, 2003. Other years, thanks to economic growth, Romney and the legislature were able to increase spending. And besides the spending reductions in that one year, Massachusetts also earned a revenue windfall from a surge in capital gains receipts.

'No secretary has ever had to deal with that,' Thompson, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, told a tea-party audience on June 4, 2012 when a man challenged him on the federal debt. Thompson spoke of the anthrax attacks that began shortly after 9/11 and the worries over biological warfare. 'At the time I was secretary, I had a few problems,' he said. 'A few problems, like there was not enough smallpox vaccine (for) America. Donna Shalala left me with 12 million doses of vaccine, all 1955 doses. And I created enough. I created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man woman and child against smallpox in America.' In this item we'll examine whether the U.S. government ramped up the smallpox vaccine program as Thompson says -- and how much credit he deserves. When asked for backup, Thompson's campaign assembled an extensive history of the episode, including news accounts. Their math: 209 million new vaccine doses through contracts Thompson pushed for, plus 340 million old doses Thompson acquired from frozen storage at a private company, Aventis Pasteur. The total would easily cover the population at the time, about 280 million. Thompson is correct about how much vaccine he inherited. We found that 10 million to 15 million doses were on hand -- a stockpile that officials learned could be safely diluted to create five times as many doses. And there is no doubt that events during Thompson's time concluded with enough vaccine becoming available for all Americans. We heard that from Steven Adams, deputy director of the Strategic National Stockpile division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Thompson's claim went much further. He said, 'I created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man woman and child against smallpox in America.' What was his role? He can't -- and doesn't -- claim credit for the 10 million to 15 million doses the government already had on hand. But Thompson did indeed help make it possible for production of 209 million new doses. So that makes the Aventis Pasteur donation of long-stored vaccine crucial. Let's look first at Thompson's math on the Aventis vaccine. The announced amount was about 85 million doses. Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said that number should be quadrupled to 340 million, citing a quote by an Aventis official who said he believed the doses could be diluted in the same fashion as the existing government stockpile. Subsequent studies confirmed that and more: the Aventis doses could be effective at a 1:10 dilution ratio. Nemoir said the government found the company, which had changed hands, so credit should go to Thompson. But when the company and Thompson announced the deal at a March 29, 2002, news conference, both made it very clear it was Aventis that approached the government shortly after the 9/11 attacks to alert officials to the stockpile in frozen storage. In fact, Aventis officials said they had years earlier alerted the federal government about the stockpile but officials had shown little interest, and the company was planning to dispose of it. So this part of the total seems to fall more into the category of a lucky break. But before we draw a conclusion, let's hear from the key players of that era, including D.A. Henderson, who led the campaign eradicating smallpox in the 1970s, which eliminated the need for the vaccine. In the late 1990s, in part as an adviser to Shalala, Henderson was among those pushing for production of 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine to control an outbreak in the case of the intentional release of the virus. The move got support but moved slowly and did not come to fruition under either President Bill Clinton or President George W. Bush after his term began in January 2001. One of Thompson's first moves after the attacks in 2001 was to personally call Henderson and get him aboard to head the government's bioterror preparedness response. Soon after, Thompson stunned Henderson and those pushing for 40 million vaccine doses. Thompson wanted more, much more: enough to vaccinate every American. Henderson was skeptical of the need but quickly realized that such a massive stockpile could help meet a broader goal of allowing the U.S. to help contain bioterror outbreaks in other countries. The idea came from Thompson, who not only pushed it hard, but packaged it in a politically savvy way that inoculated the expensive effort from political attacks, Henderson said. 'It was a master stroke to sell it that way, for 'every man, woman and child in America,'' Henderson recalled. Thompson's agency, in coordination with other departments, moved quickly to get support for and contract for private production of new vaccine. Cost estimates ranged from $1 billion to $2 billion. Two other top experts also praised Thompson. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said Thompson and Stewart Simonson, an assistant HHS secretary, took a pragmatic, hands-on approach. Thompson brought him on as a special adviser after 9/11. Anthony Fauci, the famed AIDS researcher who joined the bioterror effort, credits Thompson for spurring the dilution study on the existing stockpile, and says it's 'conceivable' that Aventis Pasteur was spurred to come forward in part by Thompson's public push for more vaccine. The company portrays it in a different light, saying it took the initiative to 'remind' the government it had the old vaccine in storage. Thompson, we think, does deserve a bit of credit for negotiating with the company to acquire the 40-year-old vaccine, which by most accounts was donated. Henderson, though, said the government paid for it.

Pence did say something very similar -- but not exactly as Kaine said. Pence had said that Putin 'has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.' However, 'stronger' is not identical to 'better.' We rate the statement Mostly True.","One of the themes of the vice presidential debate in Farmville, Va., involved Tim Kaine pressing Mike Pence on controversial statements made by either Pence or Donald Trump. Kaine, a Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia, tried particularly hard to pin his rival down on favorable statements about Russian leader Vladimir Putin. At one point, Kaine said, 'Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. ... Gov. Pence made the odd claim - he said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.' Kaine hammered the point again later in the debate. 'Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Gov. Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.' Pence, the governor of Indiana, pounced, saying, 'That is absolutely inaccurate. ... He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.' So who was right? A close look at the original comment suggests that both have a point, but neither is fully accurate. Understanding this claim requires going back to exchanges that occurred about a month earlier. On several occasions during the campaign, Trump had spoken admiringly of Putin. For instance, in NBC's Commander in Chief Forum on Sept. 7, Trump said, 'The man has very strong control over a country. It's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.' The following day, Pence was asked about Trump's remark in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Pence supported what his ticket-mate had said. 'I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,' Pence said. 'And that's going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president.' So Kaine has a point that Pence did say something seemingly favorable to Putin's leadership, saying he'd been 'a stronger leader' than Obama. But Kaine related the remark inaccurately, saying Pence had said Putin was 'a better leader than President Obama.' Pence never used the term 'better.' As it turns out, Trump himself had used the word 'better,' at least twice. During a July 27 news conference in Florida, Trump said, 'Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?' And on the July 28 edition of Fox & Friends, Trump did say Putin is 'a better leader than Obama.' But during the debate, Kaine didn't say Trump said these things. He said Pence did. Meanwhile, Pence's response to Kaine's jab wasn't airtight, either. First, Pence's counterpunch seemed to conflate his own comments on Putin with Trump's. And second, Trump was never explicit that he was referring to Putin's role on the 'world stage.'",,,,"'Gov.

Illegal crossings have been trending down since 2006, with some year-to-year fluctuations.

'Not only is there no national emergency at the border: crossings remain at historically low levels,' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C., in a Feb. 14 tweet. Price, who represents North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, which includes Orange County and parts of Wake and Durham Counties, is not the first to make this point. But we wondered if the number of border patrol apprehensions - the statistic experts generally use to measure illegal border crossings - has changed much since the last time we checked it out, so we decided to give Price's statement a fresh look. Katelynn Vogt, Price's communications director, pointed to a January 2019 FAQ from the Congressional Research Service, an article from USA Today, and related fact-checks from The New York Times and NPR as evidence in support of the claim. 'Since peaking in the year 2000, there has been a distinct downward trend in apprehensions at the southern border,' she said. 'While the specific number has fluctuated year-to-year, including a slight uptick for 2018, it remains at historically low levels.' The CRS report and data from U.S. Border Patrol indicate that apprehensions at the southwest border began a steady increase in 1960 and peaked at about 1.64 million in 2000. They then sank to a 45-year low of 303,916 in 2017. (There were 263,991 apprehensions in 1971 and only 21,022 in 1960.) But as Vogt noted, those arrests bounced back up somewhat in 2018 to 396,579. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank in Washington, D.C., noted that apprehensions were actually at their lowest during the 1960s, even though they have been 'on a significant decline' since 2006 - the last time there were more than 1 million in a year. She said the dip in 2017 occurred largely because Trump's election and his administration's tough immigration stance caused 'a temporary slowdown in apprehensions' for a few months before 'those numbers then reverted largely to their regular seasonal patterns.' But if you limit the scope of the time period, the claim is more accurate. When PolitiFact California fact-checked Gov. Gavin Newsom's State of the State address earlier this month, Ev Meade, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego, said Newsom's claim that 'we are currently experiencing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971' was 'basically true' given the long-term trend. 'It's been up and down,' Meade said. 'There's been some variation. But the long downward trend continues.' Price's statement was less precise than Newsom's, and also less precise than a similar statement that earned former California Gov. Jerry Brown a True last year. While both governors gave specific timeframes as benchmarks for their comparisons, Price said crossings 'remain at historically low levels,' which the average reader could assume means at or close to the lowest levels ever.",,,,Says border 'crossings remain at historically low levels.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

This time, he took aim at Michigan's latest effort to expand access to absentee ballots. 'Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,' Trump tweeted May 20. 'This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!' Trump is wrong. Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced May 19 that her office was mailing all registered voters an application to vote by mail in the August and November elections, not a ballot. People who complete, sign and return the application would receive a ballot about six weeks before the election. The action follows a constitutional amendment to expand access to absentee ballots, which Michiganders supported overwhelmingly in a 2018 ballot issue. We emailed the White House and the Trump campaign to ask for the basis of his claim and did not get a reply. Trump deleted his tweet about Michigan on the same day and then wrote a new tweet with mostly the same wording, referring to 'absentee ballot applications' but still alleging an illegal' action by Benson. Trump won Michigan narrowly in 2016 and has criticized efforts to expand voting by mail this year, falsely linking it to ballot fraud and arguing that it disfavors Republicans. Benson, a Democrat elected in 2018, responded to Trump on Twitter and in a written statement. 'Hi I also have a name, it's Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia,' Benson tweeted. Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it's Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy- Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) May 20, 2020 All four of those states indeed sent voters applications to receive absentee ballots for their primaries. Amid the pandemic, some state governments have already changed laws and policies to expand the option of voting by mail. At the local level, some elections officials in heavily Democratic and Republican counties around the country are mailing voters information on how to apply for an absentee ballot. Election officials say voting by mail can help reduce crowds at the polls and enforce social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Michigan voters backed changes in 2018 A recent amendment to Michigan's state constitution guarantees all registered voters the option to vote by absentee ballot for any reason. Michigan voters backed the amendment overwhelmingly in a 2018 ballot issue, along with several other measures to expand voter participation. That means all voters have the right to vote by mail, 'so it is within the Secretary's authority, as the chief elections administrator in the state, to mail applications,' Benson's spokeswoman, Tracy Wimmer, told PolitiFact. Various entities, including both major parties and advocacy organizations, routinely send absentee-ballot applications in Michigan. Nothing in state law prohibits the secretary of state from mailing out absentee-ballot applications, said Sharon Dolente, a voting rights strategist for the ACLU of Michigan. 'The Secretary of State in Michigan has broad responsibilities for managing elections and it fits within her authority,' she said. Election officials in Michigan have faced legal challenges to their authority to mail out absentee ballot applications automatically. But Benson's office said those cases involved actions by local clerks, not the secretary of state, who is the state's chief election officer. And those challenges were decided more than a decade before the constitutional amendment guaranteeing access to an absentee ballot. The absentee ballot voter application allows voters to check a box to receive absentee ballots for all future elections and has spaces for voters to provide their addresses for receiving the August and November election ballots. Of Michigan's 7.7 million registered voters, about 1.3 million are on a 'permanent absentee voter' list, which means their local election clerk automatically mails them applications ahead of every election, Benson wrote in her May 19 press release. It will cost the state about $4.5 million to mail out the applications to every voter, and the state is paying for that through the federal CARES Act. In the May 5 local elections in Michigan, the majority of voters cast ballots by mail.

'The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed,' he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. 'That's why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...' We checked whether Virginia's early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaine's term as governor from 2006 to 2010. During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginia's pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year. Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term. Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports.

'The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed,' he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. 'That's why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...' We checked whether Virginia's early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaine's term as governor from 2006 to 2010. During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginia's pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year. Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term. Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program.

Republicans kicked a total of 9 incumbent Democrats out of office in 1980 (another three lost in a primary). Since then, Republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election. Most of their success has been in winning formerly Democratic open seats. We rate Spicer's claim True.","For the past couple decades, Republicans have struggled to oust Democratic senators, though that trend is expected to change Tuesday. Many forecasters have Republicans taking up to eight Democratic Senate seats -- beating incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario pans out, Republicans will gain control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historical challenge. 'The last time we beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980,' said Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer on CNN's State of the Union on Nov. 2. It's commonly understood that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their challengers for many reasons including visibility, accomplishments in the position, and being a high-quality candidate (why they were elected in the first place). But have Republican challengers really struggled so much to take Democratic seats? We looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a Democratic senator was retiring. In 1980, Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats (nine incumbents lost in the general election, while three lost in their primaries.). Spicer is correct to say they haven't beat more than two incumbents since then. We found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half-century in the Brookings Institution's most recent 'Vital Statistics on Congress' report. (h/t to Sabato's Crystal Ball.) The arrows show when a Democratic (D) seat switched to a Republican (R) seat and vice versa. From 1981 on, Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats. Republicans' biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats -- such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they gained four, five and six open seats, respectively. Senate Democrats haven't had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years. Since 1981, they've beaten 37 incumbents total, compared to Republicans' 12. So if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday, it would be a clear break with the recent past. If Republicans take seven seats, both beating incumbents and taking open seats (which the New York Times' election model has as the most likely outcome), that will be their second-biggest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, Republicans won eight Senate seats -- beating two incumbents and taking six open seats. What made 1980 so special? In the same election, former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter. Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters, considering the Iran hostage crisis, a floundering economy and other issues. On top of Carter's struggles, there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections. Compare that to this year's Senate elections where, although there is no presidential election, Republicans are using President Barack Obama's relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats.",,,,The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates 'beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980.,supported,true,,politifact

Even though he did not make oral arguments or even appear before the justices, all the key players involved in the Hobby Lobby and Hosanna-Tabor cases say he played important, even instrumental, roles in shaping legal arguments and strategy. One case was a key ruling that limited the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of the Obama administration. The other ruling limited the the reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal law administered by the executive branch, headed by President Barack Obama. We find this claim to be Mostly True.","Throughout the primary and general election campaign, Republican Attorney General candidate Josh Hawley has made the claim that he's beaten the Obama administration at the Supreme Court twice, most notably in the Hobby Lobby case that allowed certain private companies to claim a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive requirement. 'He fought Obama at the Supreme Court - and won,' Hawley's campaign said in an ad. That's a pretty impressive claim, and something that has been questioned by others. So we wondered: What exactly was Hawley's involvement in these cases, and did he really take on President Barack Obama's administration? The briefs in each case tell us that yes, Hawley was involved in both the Hobby Lobby case as well as a case regarding an Evangelical Lutheran church and school. His name appears in both of these court documents, with his MU Law School office address listed. Hawley's initial involvement with a Supreme Court case was Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was decided in 2012. Hosanna-Tabor was a church and K-8 school located in Redford, Michigan. The lawsuit was over the firing of teacher Cheryl Perich, who was asked to resign in 2005 after being diagnosed with narcolepsy and being put on disability leave. School officials were worried Perich would be unable to complete her duties and had already hired a replacement by the time Perich received word from a doctor that she could return to work in a few months. Perich then threatened to sue the church under the Americans with Disabilities Act if they fired her. When the church did, she stuck to her word. The Supreme Court unanimously sided with Hosanna-Tabor in their ruling. The Hobby Lobby case, also known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, was very high profile, with the high court handing down its decision in 2014. It involved the Affordable Care Act's mandate that companies pay for insurance coverage for contraceptives. Burwell refers to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, who was nominated for the position by President Barack Obama. Hobby Lobby, a privately held chain of arts and crafts stores, won the case in a 5-4 decision. We reached out to Hawley's campaign to find out exactly what his involvement in each of these cases was, but they declined our interview requests. They instead provided four statements about Hawley from others who worked on the two Supreme Court cases. It's relevant to note that all of these statements are from either October or September of 2015, just months after Hawley announced his campaign to seek office. They all praise Hawley for his work with either the Hobby Lobby or Hosanna-Tabor case and claim he was an integral part of the teams of lawyers. Praise from fellow team members 'I was privileged to collaborate with Josh Hawley on the Hobby Lobby case,' wrote Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general from 2004-08 and was the sole Hobby Lobby lawyer to present oral arguments in front of the court. 'Josh was a valued member of the Hobby Lobby team, as reflected by the fact that his name was featured on the front cover of the brief,' Clement went on to write. 'I can say without hesitation that Josh Hawley was instrumental to obtaining the landmark victory that protects the religious liberty of all Americans,' wrote Kyle Duncan, who served as lead counsel for Hobby Lobby during the case. 'I personally consulted with Josh on numerous occasions about legal strategy throughout the case, and I would have been a fool not to ... The notion that Josh has somehow misrepresented his important contributions to the Hobby Lobby victory because he did not do the oral argument portion of the case in the Supreme Court is, frankly, preposterous.' 'We were - and continue to be - grateful for his involvement, which was essential to a victory for religious liberty at the Supreme Court,' wrote Peter M. Dobelbower, who served as Hobby Lobby's General Counsel. 'Josh served as co-counsel both in Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC (2012) and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014). In both cases, his work and Supreme Court expertise were critical to our success at every stage of the litigation,' read a statement from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the public interest law firm that served as counsel to plaintiffs in both cases. Hawley's role That's what Hawley's colleagues say, but we wanted to see what other information about Hawley's role exists. In a June 2014 interview about the Hobby Lobby case, Hawley said his involvement with the case came from his prior work with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the nonprofit law firm that works exclusively with religious liberty cases. 'We like to say we've defended everybody from A to Z, from Anglicans to Zoroastrians,' Hawley said in the interview. The Becket Fund served as lead counsel to Hobby Lobby during the case, with Hawley having remained counsel with the Fund. Richard Hammer, another guest on the interview, described Josh's work on the case as being 'involved in preparing the brief on behalf of Hobby Lobby,' which Hawley confirms. An article from PoliticMo in March 2014 announcing Hawley's joining of the case also describes him as 'one of a dozen lawyers in Washington, D.C., this week on Hobby Lobby's behalf and has helped prepare briefs and oral arguments for the justices to consider.' So while Hawley helped to prepare statements for the case, he never actually argued either case. In fact, according to a Supreme Court public information specialist we reached out to, Hawley wasn't admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court until May 26, 2015, well after both the Hosanna-Tabor and Hobby Lobby cases had been decided.",,,,Says 'he fought Obama at the Supreme Court - and won.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

On Dec. 1, @cursedhome posted a clip that consisted of a black-and-white still photograph of a man in a suit walking on what looked like the moon, along with the labels 'Leaked government photo from the Deep Web exposes the fake moon landing' and 'This photo is banned!' The TikTok account in question is replete with nonsensical content about 'inner earth civilizations,' alien life, and COVID-19, much of it accompanied by sensationalist labels like 'banned video,' 'this clip is banned,' and 'the government doesn't want you to see this banned documentary.' The 'faked moon landing' video was no different. The photograph in question does not constitute proof that the moon landing was faked, is not banned, and is not owned by the U.S. government. Thus, @cursedhome managed to pack three significant falsehoods into just 16 words. The photograph was taken in September 1969, after the successful Apollo 11 mission to the moon in July that year. It shows the controversial former Nazi aeronautics engineer Wernher von Braun, who was brought to the U.S. after World War II and played a key role in developing the rocket technology used in the Apollo 11 mission. In the photograph, von Braun is walking on a replica model of the moon landing at the Southeastern Fair in Atlanta, Georgia. The photo was attributed to United Press International (UPI), a leading news agency at that time, and not the U.S. government, and it was republished by several regional newspapers, along with the following caption: 'Dr. Wernher von Braun, one of the leaders in America's space flight program, took a walk on the moon as he strolled through an exact replica of the Apollo 11 moon landing after officially opening the exhibition at Atlanta's Southeastern Fair.' Previewing the fair, on Sept. 1, 1969, the Atlanta Constitution reported: A detailed reenactment of man's first walk on the moon, including authentic moon surface with small craters and flat rocks and a replica of the landing module will be a major attraction at this year's Southeastern Fair, opening Sept. 25. A tableau of the actual moon walk will be staged in the administration building of the fair, which has been cleared to make way for concrete, sand and other materials needed to build an authentic moon surface down to the minute details, including the footprints of the astronauts. The next month, the Atlanta Constitution followed up with an article that included a photograph of two local gardening enthusiasts 'planting' flowers on that same replica moon surface: The photograph is also not 'banned' or available only on the 'deep web.'

34107,117082,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/apr/28/william-barber/nc-naacp-president-says-80-percent-think-minimum-w/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling It's impossible to say for certain that a full 80 percent of North Carolinians want a living wage in North Carolina, like Barber said. But it does appear that a vast majority support the idea, including about half of Republicans and nearly all Democrats. One recent poll found 76 percent support for a $10 or higher minimum wage. With a margin of error of 3.4 points, Barber's 80 percent claim would be well within reason if this was the only recent poll. But another recent poll found just 65 percent support. The average of the two polls is 70.5 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.","In the rallies against North Carolina's new LGBT law, commonly known as HB2, protesters have represented not just gay and transgender activists. Also present Monday for the rallies outside the legislature were Latino activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter and Rise Up for $15 movements. The law doesn't just ban transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also bans local governments - cities and counties - from raising the minimum wage that businesses within their boundaries would have to pay workers. Rev. William Barber, president of the N.C. NAACP, said the crowds of protesters were more diverse than just LGBT activists because of the wage issue. And in a speech just days before Monday's protests, he said the bathroom issue was actually a Trojan Horse, of sorts, for what he deems the real intent of the law - stopping cities from raising the minimum wage, as such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles have recently done. 'Eighty percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage,' Barber said. 'So if North Carolina's legislature and the governor had just put on the table a straight bill to make a prohibition against living wages, they would have been going against 80 percent of North Carolinians.' A higher minimum wage is often opposed by Republican politicians. But if Barber was right, a higher minimum wage is a true bipartisan issue - something that 4 out of 5 people support in a state where 4 out of 10 are Democrats. What is a living wage? Polling on this issue is all over the place. There are many ways to ask the question. Some polls give a specific number they test for approval; some let the respondents choose a number; some simply ask whether the minimum wage should be higher; some ask who should have the power to make that decision. But first, perhaps we should define 'living wage,' the phrase Barber used in place of 'higher minimum wage.' It's not just a political catchphrase; there are actual ways of calculating it. In 2004, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning created what she called the Living Wage Calculator. Accounting for location-specific factors such as the cost of food, childcare, housing, transportation and taxes, the tool determines the 'living wage' as well as 'poverty wage' for states, counties and metro areas. It gives numbers in both wage categories for single adults or couples, and households with zero to three children. It also assumes full-time employment of 2,080 work hours per year (40 hours a week for 52 weeks). For the purposes of this report, we'll look at the wage for a single person with no children. Right now the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, although some states and cities have gone higher. North Carolina has not, and as Barber accurately said, the state has now forbidden any individual city or county from raising it. In Wake and Mecklenburg counties - the two largest in North Carolina - the Living Wage Calculator says a living wage would be right about $11 an hour. The state average is $10.53, and 13 of 14 metropolitan areas are above $10. A person working full time for $10.53 an hour would make $21,902.40 a year. At the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, that same person would make $15,080 a year - a difference of more than $6,800. Recent polling Now that we know what a living wage is, we can look to see whether Barber is right about 80 percent support. The topic isn't surveyed much at the state level, but luckily two polls have tackled this topic in the last month. They're from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling and the more centrist Elon University Poll. A spokesman for the state's main right-leaning polling firm, The Civitas Institute, said there's no record of Civitas ever having polled people on the topic of minimum wage. Public Policy Polling found that 76 percent of North Carolinians support a minimum wage of at least $10 an hour. That isn't an exact confirmation of Barber's claim, since it's slightly lower than 80 percent and the living wage is $10.53, not $10, but it's pretty close. However, the Elon poll found less support for a $10 or higher minimum wage, 65 percent. It also arrived at that number differently than PPP. PPP gave five choices, asking people to say if they thought there shouldn't be a minimum wage, if it should remain $7.25, or if it should increase to $10, $12 or $15. Elon asked people to name whatever they thought the minimum wage should be. A plurality (27 percent) said $10. In total, 65 percent said $10 or higher. That's certainly less than the 80 percent claim Barber made or the 76 percent that PPP found. But complicating matters, Elon also found less support than PPP for keeping the current minimum wage. The difference is that many in the Elon Poll (23 percent) named a number between $7.26 and $9.99 - an option that PPP didn't give. So while the Elon poll found only 65 percent support for wages that could be called a living wage under the MIT definition, it did find 88 percent support for raising the minimum wage at least a little. Political breakdown Barber framed his claim in the context of the state's Republican leaders trying to avoid blowback for putting restrictions on a higher minimum wage. So we decided to look at how Republicans feel about the subject. Just like they phrased their questions differently, PPP and Elon also asked about party affiliations differently. PPP found that 63 percent of people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 also support at least a $10 minimum wage, as do 92 percent of Barack Obama voters and 65 percent of others. The Elon poll found that 46 percent of self-identified Republicans support a $10 or higher minimum wage, compared with 86 percent of Democrats and with 62 percent of others.",,,,'80 percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage',supported,mostly-true,,politifact
22317,11267,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fox-skews/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Rumors have circulated since at least 2009 claiming that the Fox News cable television channel fought successfully in court for the right to lie, misinform, or deceive viewers. The claim that Fox News legally won the 'right to lie' has been repeated across the internet despite its being factually inaccurate on more than one level. First, the case from which the rumor stemmed resulted in a Florida appeals court ruling in February 2003, not 2004. More germane to the rumor, however, is the fact that the case at hand did not involve the national Fox News Channel; rather, it was a breach of contract lawsuit filed by two reporters against their former employer, Tampa Bay television station WTVT. (The situation was somewhat more complicated because WTVT was an affiliate of the Fox television network and was also owned by Fox, but the Fox television network and the Fox News Channel are two distinctly different entities.) The legal battle to which the rumor refers was about a husband-and-wife reporting team, Jane Aker and Steve Wilson, who in 1996 put together a story about the use of the Monsanto-produced synthetic bovine growth hormone (BGH) Posilac by Florida dairy farmers. WTVT's management asserted that the reporters' BGH piece was alarmist and one-sided and ordered the reporters to edit their story to produce a more 'balanced' piece. Aker and Wilson defied those orders; as a result, the BGH story never aired, and the pair were terminated by WTVT in 1997. The two reporters sued the station for breach of contract and retaliatory firing the following year, maintaining that they had been unfairly terminated from their jobs for 'resisting WTVT's attempts to distort or suppress the BGH story' at the behest of Fox corporate and Monsanto, and that the station's management had fired them in retaliation over their threats to file a complaint about WTVT's 'deliberate news distortion' to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC): In September 1997, WTVT notified Akre and Wilson that it was exercising its option to terminate their employment contracts without cause. Akre and Wilson responded in writing to WTVT threatening to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission ('FCC') alleging that the station had 'illegally' edited the still unfinished BGH report in violation of an FCC policy against federally licensed broadcasters deliberately distorting the news. The parties never resolved their differences regarding the content of the story, and consequently, the story never aired. In April 1998, Akre and Wilson sued WTVT alleging, among other things, claims under the whistle-blower's statute. Those claims alleged that their terminations had been in retaliation for their resisting WTVT's attempts to distort or suppress the BGH story and for threatening to report the alleged news distortion to the FCC. Akre also brought claims for declaratory relief and for breach of contract. After a four-week trial, a jury found against Wilson on all of his claims. The trial court directed a verdict against Akre on her breach of contract claim, Akre abandoned her claim for declaratory relief, and the trial court let her whistle-blower claims go to the jury. The jury rejected all of Akre's claims except her claim that WTVT retaliated against her in response to her threat to disclose the alleged news distortion to the FCC. The jury awarded Akre $425,000 in damages. Another common misconception is that Fox News invoked First Amendment protections in order to retain the 'right to lie' during the lengthy legal battle between the couple and the Florida Fox affiliate. There was no mention of any such claim in the appeals court decision, and Akre herself does not corroborate it. Ultimately, the FCC concluded in 2007 that the conflict between Akre and Wilson and the affiliate boiled down to an 'editorial dispute ... rather than a deliberate effort by [WTVT] to distort news.' The 'right to lie' claims are similar to another false story about Fox News' trustworthiness, that the network was banned in Canada because it does not meet stringent Canadian broadcast standards for truthfulness.","Did Fox News Sue for the 'Right to Lie'?

Gift from the people of Russia.......'Monument to the struggle against world terrorism, artist Zurab Tesereteii' ....it is an impressive memorial and statement against terrorism. The walkway is made of stones. Names of the persons killed on 9 11 are inscribed on the base like the Vietnam Memorial wall. It was a cold and windy day but well worth the drive to see. It is down in the shipping yards across from 'The Lady'. The monument was the work of Russian artist Zurab Tsereteli, whose inspiration was described thusly in a brochure about the monument: 'To the Struggle Against World Terrorism' was conceived as the events of 9/11 unfolded and Russian artist Zurab Tsereteli walked the streets of Moscow. Struck by the outpouring of grief he observed, a memorial with an image of a tear formed in his mind. Shortly after the attacks, Tsereteli visited ground zero and looked to New Jersey's waterfront for an appropriate site for a monument honoring victims of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks. Bayonne was a fitting location; the city was an arrival point for many New York City evacuees on 9/11, a staging area for rescuers, and offered a direct view of the Statue of Liberty and the former World Trade Center towers. A gift from Tsereteli and the Russian people, the memorial is made of steel sheathed in bronze. Standing 100 feet high, its center contains a jagged tear. In it hangs a 40-foot stainless steel teardrop, representing sadness and grief over the loss of life, but also hope for a future free from terror. Etched in granite on an 11-sided base are the names of the nearly 3,000 killed in the 1993 World Trade Center bombings and terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Photographs of the monument's construction (as well as the finished version of the memorial) can be viewed at the 911 Monument web site. A portfolio of Tsereteli's other works around the world is also available on The New Yorker's web site.",9/11 Tear Drop Memorial Photographs show a New Jersey monument to the victims of 9/11 that was donated by Russia.

On 14 September 2012, thirty-four weeks into her pregnancy, Heather Brown fell into a coma due to preeclampsia (the development of high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy). In an effort to preserve the lives of Heather and her unborn child, doctors delivered her baby, John Michael Thomas Brown, by cesarean section on 15 September 2012. Sean Brown rushed home from Afghanistan to be with his wife and newborn son, but as of 22 October 2012 Heather Brown remains in a coma.On 20 October 2012, residents of the Browns' hometown 'turned Gladewater yellow' as a show of support for the family:Gladewater residents purchased yellow ribbons and shirts Saturday to demonstrate their support for the Sean Brown family by 'turning Gladewater yellow.' As friends and family of the Gladewater police officer continue to post the ribbons at their homes or on their clothing, people from across the nation are donning yellow ribbons in solidarity, as well. The yellow ribbons [Heather] tied to trees outside their Gladewater home - which she intended to display until his safe return from the war - remain displayed as Sean Brown prays for his wife to fully recover and come home from the hospital. The yellow ribbon has been adopted by friends, family and caring strangers as word of the couple's situation spreads across social media. The symbol of support for the Browns has been placed on trees, cars, Facebook profile pictures and mailboxes, from Gladewater to Utah and New York. All proceeds of Saturday's event went to the 'Heather and John Brown Fund' at Austin Bank.Although the Brown family is seeking only prayer and positive thoughts for Heather rather than monetary donations, a fund has been established to provide financial help for Sean and Heather and their newborn son:Sean Brown said he is not looking for donations, but an account has been set up at Austin Bank to receive them. It is called the 'Heather and John Brown Fund.' Longtime family friend Charity Robinson said donations would help Brown spend time with his son when he is released from the hospital. 'Sean and John need some time together,' she said. 'It would be wonderful if the funds were there for Sean and John, so Sean didn't have to go to work immediately.' The main request of the family is prayer. 'I am not expecting donations. What I am asking for is prayer and positive thoughts,' Sean Brown said. 'Family and the church community - they are the main mental foundations that I have had to lean to during this time ... I have had nowhere else to go but family, friends and the Lord.'Updates on the status of the Brown family can be found on their Facebook page.",Bringing Home the Browns,"Prayers are requested for Heather Brown, who remains in a coma after giving birth to a son?","Yeakely, Richard.

30429,116105,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/sep/16/facebook-posts/facebook-post-recognizes-little-known-space-fact/, ,0,0,,,We rate the Facebook Communion claim True.,"Occasionally a claim comes across our desks here at PolitiFact Georgia that seems to touch all bases -- this one has God, politics and even men landing on the moon. The claim hinted at political ramifications and a possible government cover-up. And it was broadcast as a viral Facebook post. What more could a fact-checker ask for? So let's go back a bit, to 1969 and man's first landing on the moon, a feat that seemed almost magical to anyone watching and listening. 'Not many people know it but on July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin took communion on the moon. The very first meal ever taken on the moon was the blood and body of Christ!' the Facebook post read. We had heard about astronauts partaking of freeze-dried food and dehydrated drinks. And we knew about the Apollo 8 crew on Christmas Eve 1968 reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon, an event heard by millions. But the Holy Communion claim was new to us. We decided to do some exploring of our own. The Facebook post about Aldrin led to a post on the JesusLovesYou.org website, a member of the Greater Good Network of websites. The sites promote numerous nonprofit organizations for contributions. That post references Aldrin's comments on the experience: 'I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this,' Aldrin said. 'NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O'Hare (sic), the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon Christmas (Eve in 1968). I agreed reluctantly.' So, is that why we hadn't heard about the moon service? Did NASA, under pressure from an atheist activist, try to keep the Christian observance a secret? Our research on this claim led to several sources about the holy meal, but we wanted to hear directly from Aldrin himself. Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 space mission that put the first people on the moon on July 20, 1969. He was the second person to walk on the moon, following fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong. The moonwalker is currently on a tour promoting his newest book, 'Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration.' We tracked down his tour publicist at National Geographic Books, but unfortunately,we were unable to schedule an interview by press time. Aldrin is now consulting for the U.S. government about the future of the country's space program and how to make space more accessible to everyday people The Communion event was re-enacted during Episode Six of the HBO-television miniseries 'From the Earth to the Moon.' The one-season, 12-episode miniseries ran in 1998. It was a dramatized portrayal of the Apollo manned space program's expeditions to the moon. But in a Guideposts article after the 1969 mission, Aldrin confirmed that the religious meal took place inside the Eagle spacecraft once it landed on the moon. 'I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup,' Aldrin said. 'It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.' He then recited a Bible verse, John 15:5. NASA history also mentions Aldrin's Communion service. In his memoirs, Aldrin notes that Armstrong did not participate in the Communion service. Aldrin also expressed second thoughts about his religious observance. 'Neil watched respectfully but made no comment to me at the time,' Aldrin wrote. 'Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind -- be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists.' Aldrin initially wanted his Communion service broadcast on the air with the rest of his comments and biblical reading. But NASA decided against that idea. It was conducted during 'radio silence,' which means that only he and Armstrong witnessed it. There was no communication between the spacecraft and Mission Control in Houston during radio silence. Atheist activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair had already sued NASA over the 1968 Bible reading in space. O'Hair said the reading violated the legal separation of church and state. 'Although O'Hair's ideas did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without,' Aldrin wrote. (The case was eventually rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.) So during radio silence, Aldrin read his Bible verse and took his Communion. Aldrin kept his on-air comments more general. He asked for a few moments of silence 'to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.' To sum up, a Facebook post claimed that NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin took Communion on the moon. Several sources, including NASA records and Aldrin's memoirs, include accounts of the Communion service. PolitiFact also discovered that Aldrin's church, outside of Houston, still celebrates the lunar Communion service each year on the Sunday closest to the July 20, 1969, moon landing.

While the advertisement may have prompted some consumers to go out and buy a new pair of sneakers (the company's online sales increased 31%), others vehemently disagreed with Kaepernick's involvement and showed their displeasure by posting photographs and videos (purportedly) showeing them burning various pieces of Nike apparel. So how did Nike respond to this backlash? According to a viral Facebook post, the company released a new pair of sneakers designed to look as if they had been burned in order to clap back on these protesters: This post does not picture an official product offered by Nike. The photograph captures a pair of custom Nike Monarchs that were hand-painted by artist Kelsey Amy, the proprietor of Shme Customs. Although this image of these 'burned' sneakers didn't go viral until September 2018, when they were incorrectly associated with protests against Nike, Amy explained in an Instagram post that she had actually created these shoes months earlier for two customers who requested a pair of grilling-inspired sneakers: The 'Burnt Ends' Nike Monarchs Made these a few months ago and realized I ever shared them 🤦🏼‍♀️ Made these for the guys over @traegergrills and Matt Pittman of @meatchurch for an event at Nike in the beginning of June. Had to lace the guys with some Monnie heat to ensure their grilling abilities were up to par! Once the guys had the shoes they came up with the 'burnt ends' nickname which I thought fit the shoes perfectly. @mache275 is the originator of the burnt shoe theme and @justwincustoms who has done some incredible iterations as well. Wanted to get the Monnie in on the action, hopefully it did the theme justice! Amy uses a variety of sneakers to create her one-of-a-kind artworks, but the Nike Monarch appears to be one of her favorites.

Their campaigns sent dueling press releases June 15 and 16, 2010, trying to portray their opponent's business practices as being too friendly to illegal immigrants. The Republicans' positions on illegal immigration will be key for primary voters. If elected, Scott has promised to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida -- a law that requires officers who have made lawful stops to check an individual's immigration status. PolitiFact gave McCollum a full-flop for sending mixed signals on the law. McCollum sent these fighting words in a press release June 15, 2010: 'In just the latest case of hypocrisy, it was revealed today that Rick Scott has heavily invested in a company that is geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country. ... Rick Scott says he wants to crack down on illegal immigration, but now we find out he has been profiting from illegal immigrants.' The following day, June 16, 2010, Scott's campaign issued a press release about McCollum which stated: 'Bill McCollum jumped his sinking ship of a campaign today and fled to Washington, D.C., where he served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants.'' In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether Scott invested in a company that is 'geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to friends and family out of the country.' What's the McCollum campaign talking about? The campaign provided a copy of a June 15, 2010, article in the Orlando Sentinel that stated that opposition research shows 'Scott's investment company was one of a handful of equity investors that lent $12.5 million in 2004 and 2005 to Emida Technologies. Emida provides electronic pre-paid services ranging from phone cards to money transfers, and focuses on Central and South American markets. According to its Web site, the company also partnered with another called IPP, which primarily focused on helping Hispanic migrant workers in Arizona transfer money and pay bills back in Mexico. Press releases from the company list Richard L. Scott Investments, LLC, as an equity partner.' Rick Scott spokeswoman Mary Anne Carter said that Scott's company did invest in Emida Technologies, but she described it as a prepaid cell phone company. RLSI Emida Capital Partners, LLC was set up to invest in Emida, Carter wrote in an e-mail. That company invested about $2 million in 2004 and about $1 million in 2005. Scott's personal portion was $736,004, Carter wrote. Since Scott doesn't dispute that he invested in Emida, the only question is whether Emida allows illegal immigrants to send money to friends or family in other countries. But first, some background on Emida. The company, formerly located in Miami and now based in Foot Hills, Calif., and Bogata, Colombia, started in 2001, according to a March 14, 2006, article in Business Wire. An article in the Miami Herald Dec. 22, 2003, described Emida as 'a provider of transactional networks for electronic prepaid distribution, bill payment and money transfer services targeting the global Hispanic market.' In 2005, Emida merged with Debisys Inc. -- another electronic prepaid solution company. Information on the privately-held company's website states that it has technology that 'enables the domestic and international distribution and value transfer of many types of prepaid products and payment services. Our strategy is to build profitable, robust distribution networks for many prepaid products in targeted operating geographies, and to introduce unique cross border value products between regions.' To learn more about Emida, we spoke to Martyn Fricker, director of business development and marketing. We asked Fricker to describe what Emida does. He described a typical prepaid wireless phone plan, purchased by customers in the United States, allowing the recipient in Latin America to make calls but not get cash. Could illegal immigrants be customers? 'The merchants who offer this service I'm not sure they ask 'are you an illegal immigrant?'' Fricker said. So where does the idea about 'money transfer' come from? Fricker said Emida has wanted to expand into the money transfer business and has recently launched or is launching two other money-transfer or 'virtual wallet' products. But he said neither one has had a single transaction as of June 16, 2010. If those products have only been recently launched, we asked why Emida was described as providing 'money transfer' since at least 2004. 'Sometimes private companies tell people about capabilities,' Fricker said, to draw their interest 'before they have the capability to deliver.' So where does that leave us? There is no dispute that Emida could allow illegal immigrants in the U.S. to put money on cell phones for friends and relatives in other countries. Is that the same as a money transfer? Technically, no, but helping a relative keep their cell phone service available is financial help. McCollum's claim was that Scott invested in a company that was 'geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country.' Emida's spokesman and its press releases acknowledge that's the business the company is pursuing. Even if some of Emida's products are just launching this year, news articles since at least 2003 have described the company as providing 'money transfer' -- even a press release from the company used that phrase in 2004 -- so it is clearly 'geared to' that business.

But those without a college degree are hurting even more, according to President Barack Obama, who was in Austin last week to raise money for fellow Democrats. 'Now, I know some folks argue that as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, my administration should focus solely on economic issues,' he said during a side speech at the University of Texas at Austin on Aug. 9. 'But as I said the other week to the National Urban League, education is an economic issue. It may be the economic issue of our time. It's an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have.' Almost double? Matt Lehrich, a White House spokesman, pointed us to employment data kept by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking at labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey, the unemployment rate for those with at least a bachelor's degree was 4.5 percent in July 2010, while 10.1 percent of high school graduates who didn't attend college were without jobs. Add those who never graduated from high school, and the unemployment rate creeps up to 11 percent. That's more than double the unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's, master's, doctorate or professional degree. Include those who attend attended 'some college' or earned an associates degree, and the jobless rate for the college crowd is 6 percent. So, as of July, the unemployment rate for those who never went to college is almost double what it is for those who have. How did the two unemployment rates shake out historically? The data during the last two years show similar ratios. In 2009, on average, about 10.9 percent of those who never attended college were unemployed, while 6.1 percent of those with at least some college were unemployed. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent for those without college, and about 3.1 for those who had.

The lengthy message is largely based off of an article published by Right Wing News in October 2013, which claimed that Obama was employing 'back door gun control' by closing the plant and thereby forcing U.S. residents to purchase ammunition from overseas manufacturers: Obama and the EPA just shut down the last lead smelting plant in the US. They raised the EPA regulations by 10 fold and it would have cost the plant $100 million to comply. You can own all the guns you want, but if you can't get ammo, you are out of luck. The Doe Run Company has shuttered its lead smelting plant, but that action occurred in 2013, had little to do with Obama administration policies, and did not lead to a massive ammunition shortage. The closure of Doe Run Company's primary lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri, was the result of the business' failure to meet existing air quality standards (set by the EPA in 2008, before Barack Obama took office). Doe Run reached a settlement of the issue with the EPA in 2010 and agreed to close the lead smelting plant by the end of 2013: In 2010, Doe Run reached a comprehensive settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Missouri. As part of that settlement, the Company agreed to discontinue its smelting operations in Herculaneum by the end of 2013. Over the operating life of the smelter, the Company spent millions of dollars in environmental and other upgrades. Continuing to upgrade the aging smelter to attempt to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations imposed on primary lead smelters was not economically feasible given the many other requirements of our business.* *In 2008, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for lead was reduced from 1.5 µg/m3 (micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air) to 0.15 µg/m3. When the closure date (31 December 2013) approached, web sites such as Right Wing News published misleading articles asserting that President Obama and the EPA had colluded to shut down the plant in an effort to limit the availability of ammunition in the U.S. But the closure was driven by air quality regulations established during the presidency of George W. Bush and had nothing to do with Barack Obama or any furtive move on his part to effect 'back door gun control.' Additionally, fears about the closure's effect on the availability of ammunition were vastly overblown. Most manufacturers employ secondary plants that use recycled materials to make ammunition. Primary plants, such as the aforementioned lead smelter in Missouri, use mined resources and typically produce batteries: More than 80 percent of all lead produced in the U.S. is used in either motive batteries to start vehicles, or in stationary batteries for backup power (particular in military, telecom and medical applications). In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product. These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri. Lead is used in numerous other products, including ammunition and construction materials, as well as to protect against radiation in medical and military applications. While most applications can use secondary lead, those applications that require primary lead will need to import the lead metal in the future. Any additional demand for lead (above that which can be met through recycling at secondary smelters) will also have to be met through imports. Several ammunition manufacturers commented on the controversy when it was relevant in 2013. For instance, Sierra (The Bulletsmiths) said that the Doe Run plant's closure would not affect their business: The main question asked is 'Will this shut down your supply of lead?' The answer to that is no. First, Sierra buys lead from several different vendors to maintain constant supply. Second, this facility only smelts primary lead or lead ore. This is lead ore that has just been brought out of the earth. Sierra uses no primary lead at all and never has, so we use nothing directly from this facility.; The lead we buy from Doe Run comes from their recycling facility in Boss, MO that is about 90 miles away from the smelter that is closing. The facility we buy from is still going strong and delivering to us as scheduled. The lead from this facility is from recycled lead, mostly coming from car batteries. This is a continuing 'in and out' cycle for them and the smelter closing will not affect this facility. The National Rifle Association (NRA) also issued a statement noting that 'lead usage in ammunition makes up only about three percent of lead consumption in the United States' and that the domestic ammunition industry would survive the closure of the Doe Run lead smelter plant just fine: We previously reported on the closure of the nation's last primary lead smelter due to tightened EPA standards on ambient air quality. As the date for closure of the smelter approaches, there has been a significant amount of speculation concerning the effect of the smelter's closure on the availability and price of ammunition. According to the United States Geological Survey, lead usage in ammunition makes up only about three percent of lead consumption in the United States. Lead-acid batteries make up the vast majority of U.S. lead consumption, and these batteries are readily recycled. This recycled lead, which will still be able to be smelted in the United States at secondary smelters even after the Herculaneum smelter closes, is the type most often used by ammunition manufacturers. Speculation about the effect of the Herculaneum smelter's closure has caused a number of ammunition manufacturers, including Sierra and Federal, to issue public statements on their ability to continue to source lead for ammunition production. As Lawrence Keane, the senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, pointed out to Emily Miller of the Washington Times, ammunition producers have known for some time of the impending closure of the Herculaneum smelter and do not believe that the closure will affect production of lead ammunition components.",Doe Run Lead Plant Shut Down to Effect 'Back Door Gun Control' Rumors about a mass ammunition shortage supposedly caused by a forced closure of the Doe Run Lead Plant are old and inaccurate.

In one portion of the interview that got the internet buzzing, the couple discussed how after they left England, they abruptly found their safety compromised in the area where they initially settled near Vancouver, Canada. This was in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. A British tabloid had just published their exact location, and the royal family had withdrawn security for the couple. 'Suddenly it dawned on me, 'Hang on a second, the borders could be closed, we're having our security removed, who knows how long the lockdown's gonna be. The world knows where we are. It's not safe, it's not secure, we probably need to get out of here,'' the Prince told Winfrey. And get out of there they did, with the help of entertainment mogul Tyler Perry, who let the family stay at his own home in Los Angeles and also provided them with security. They stayed at Perry's home for several months, saying that it 'gave us breathing room to try to figure out what we were going to do,' the Duchess recounted.

Tom Wolf for gas prices in Pennsylvania being higher than in 13 other states, where prices had dropped recently to lower than $1 per gallon in some places, while prices in Pennsylvania were above $2 A recent survey found gas prices under $1 in 13 states. Pennsylvania has the second-highest gas tax in the nation and gas taxes are a major reason why gas is more expensive in Pennsylvania. But large increases in Pennsylvania's gas tax took place under a law that was adopted before Wolf was elected. And there are other reasons - distance from supply, supply disruptions, and retail competition and operating costs - that cause gas prices to vary by region. We rate the Facebook post Mostly False.","Across the country, lower gasoline prices - dipping to below $1 per gallon, in some places - have been one byproduct of the COVID-19 outbreak. Pennsylvania is the exception, according to a Facebook post that blames Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. It says: 'Pennsylvania gasoline - $2.27/gallon. Ohio gasoline - 99 cents/gallon. Actually, 13 states under a dollar! Thanks Gov. Wolf!' The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Even within a state, gas prices vary, of course. Leaving aside the precise cost of a gallon of regular unleaded on a given day, it's fair to say that Pennsylvania's gas prices are on the high end nationally. But gas taxes are only one reason gas prices vary among the states. And large gas tax hikes in Pennsylvania were done with a law that was enacted before Wolf was elected. Pennsylvania gas prices higher On May 2, the day of the Facebook post, the average price of regular gas in Pennsylvania was $2.03 per gallon, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact. Forty states had averages of $1.99 or less. That post was removed while we were preparing this fact-check. But the same image was posted by another Facebook user on May 4.) On May 6, as we prepared this fact-check, the average price per gallon in Pennsylvania was $2.028 - ninth-highest in the country, according to AAA. Oklahoma was lowest, at $1.391. In a comment to his post, the Facebook user cited an April 20 news article from a San Francisco TV station. That article cited a report three days earlier from GasBuddy.com, an app that tracks gas prices, that said gas prices were under $1 in 13 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania gas taxes higher Pennsylvania's total gas tax (state plus federal) is 77.1 cents per gallon. That is second only to California's 79 cents, as of Jan. 1, 2020, according to the American Petroleum Institute. (The federal tax alone is 18.4 cents per gallon.) Pennsylvania's gas tax is more than twice as high as the tax in three of the other 13 states cited in the Facebook post (Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma). Here are the total gas taxes in those 13 states, in cents per gallon: Arkansas (43.2), Colorado (40.4), Iowa (48.9), Kansas (42.43), Kentucky (44.4), Michigan (60.38), Mississippi (37.19), Missouri (35.82), New York (63.43), Ohio (56.91), Oklahoma (38.4), Virginia (40.35) and Wisconsin (51.3). Why Pennsylvania gas costs more Asked why Pennsylvania's prices at the pump are higher than in the other 13 states, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told PolitiFact it's generally because of the state's higher gas tax. But there are also regional factors, he said. Distance from supply, supply disruptions, and retail competition and operating costs all play a role, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal office. Marc Stier, director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, noted that states such as Arizona, which has one of the lowest gas taxes, and Nevada, which is roughly in the middle, have higher gas prices than Pennsylvania. As of May 6, according to AAA, the average price per gallon was less than 1 cent higher in Arizona than in Pennsylvania, but more than 30 cents higher in Nevada. The governor's role When we asked Wolf's office about the Facebook post, we were referred to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. A spokesman responded by citing a 2013 Pennsylvania law that raised money for transportation. That law was signed by Wolf's predecessor, Republican Tom Corbett. It resulted in a series of increases in the state's portion of the gas - from 32.3 cents per gallon to 58.7 cents. Stier said he is not aware of any attempts by Wolf, who took office in 2015, to reduce gas taxes. Wolf has defended the 2013 tax law as a mechanism to improve aging roads and bridges. In 2017, he and the Republican-controlled legislature allowed another increase from the 2013 law to take effect.",,,,"Gas is under $1 in 13 states, but $2.27 in Pennsylvania, because of the governor.",refuted,barely-true,"<p>High gas taxes are one reason Pennsylvania's gas prices are higher, but large increases result from a law that was adopted before he took office.</p>",politifact

Virginia ranked 39th in the nation on that date. Although not part of this ruling, it should be noted that Virginia has since fallen to 48th, even though it has picked up pace in giving vaccines. We rate Cox's statement True.","Del. Kirk Cox has been leading Republican criticism that Virginia is off to a slow start in getting COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of citizens. Cox laid the blame on outgoing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam on Jan. 13 during the GOP response to Northam's State of the Commonwealth speech. 'The Northam administration's ability to distribute and administer vaccines has been extremely disappointing,' Cox said. 'Ranking in the bottom third of states nationally, every state we border is doing a better job than Virginia in administering this life-saving vaccine.' Cox, from Colonial Heights, is a former speaker of the House who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination this year, and his criticism is likely to become a campaign issue. So we fact checked his claim about Virginia's bottom-third ranking and found that he was being charitable in describing the roll out. The day Cox made his statement, Virginia ranked 39th among states in getting its allotted vaccine doses into people's arms, according to Becker's Hospital Review, a health systems website that, among many other things, analyzes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since then, Virginia's ranking has fallen. On Jan. 19, the latest date of CDC data available at this writing, Virginia ranked 48th. From the 853,000 vaccines distributed to the state, 327,000 shots were given - a 38.3% rate. The national rate was 50.4%. The two states trailing Virginia were Georgia and Alabama. North Dakota had the highest rate, using 82% of its allotted vaccines for shots. Northam's response At a Jan. 14 news conference, Northam said he was satisfied with the vaccine rollout. 'This is probably one of the most massive logistical efforts that has ever taken place in Virginia, when you think about it, to get 8.5 million Virginians not one dose, but two doses,' he said. 'I'm pleased with the way we've rolled.' Administration officials have said published Virginia data is undercounted because of delays and glitches in the state's electronic reporting system. During the seven-day period ending on Jan. 19, Virginia averaged giving 17,464 shots a day, according to the state Department of Health's dashboard. Northam said he wants to reach 50,000 shots a day and have all Virginians double vaccinated by early to mid summer. Northam took steps last week to speed things up. He announced that all people 65 and older would now be eligible for the vaccine, and so would people aged 16 to 64 with health problems. Northam said that makes about half of Virginians eligible for vaccines. The rest will qualify later.",,,,Virginia ranks 'in the bottom third of states' in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.,supported,true,,politifact

Sebelius made the claim while discussing the need to provide better health care under the federal government's Medicare program. The White House has begun a program to reduce preventable medical errors. The secretary attempted to drive home the seriousness of the issue by telling the story of a Stone Mountain woman who got an infection during ankle surgery. The woman, Sebelius said, needed another surgery to remove screws previously put in her ankle. She had to take antibiotics at home, needed weekly visits from a home health nurse and additional treatment from a doctor to make sure the infection went away. Sebelius said such tales are not rare. Still, we wondered about the frequency. Is it really one of three? The secretary's office said her claim came from a recent study in the journal Health Affairs.

But is the statistic that Sebelius quoted correct? Doctors and medical experts began paying more attention to medical errors during care after a landmark 1999 study by the Institute of Health, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers concluded that as many as 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors. In November, a team of doctors released its findings on five years worth of medical records from 10 randomly selected hospitals in North Carolina between 2002 and 2007. They chose that state because it has worked hard to improve patient safety in recent years. The research found '25.1 patient harms per 100 admissions.' Nearly one out of five patients had an adverse effect from medical care, the study found. The greatest percentage of harms came from medical procedures. Medications were a close second. Infections were third on the list. Dr. Christopher Landrigan, the lead author of the North Carolina study, said the adverse effect from medicine could range from a condition that requires a hospital stay to something as simple as a rash. Landrigan, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical Center, said medical errors occur because care and treatment are imperfect. 'The root cause of it is medicine is very complicated,' Landrigan said, explaining why medical errors are so alarmingly high. 'There is a high risk of something going wrong.' The April report that Sebelius referenced focused on three hospitals of different sizes located in different parts of the United States. The researchers, led by Dr. David C. Classen, randomly selected patients from all adult age groups admitted to those hospitals during the month of October 2004 and reviewed the records of 795 patients. The largest forms of problems, nearly 40 percent of them, were related to medicine given for a surgery or procedure. The second-leading cause, nearly 30 percent, was procedure-related. Infections were the third-leading cause, the study found. About one third of the problems required a longer hospital stay. Nearly 8 percent resulted in permanent patient harm, a lifesaving procedure or death. Landrigan said he didn't dispute the research in the Health Affairs report. He said Classen and his fellow researchers were more experienced in using some of the tools now used to detect medical errors. Classen and his team did use a broader definition of adverse events than in other studies, saying they did not restrict themselves to whether they were preventable or led to a major disability. 'Fundamentally, the methodology was very sound,' Landrigan said. To date, other reviews of the study have been well-received.

To sum up, Sebelius repeated information from a report that falls in line with other research showing that the problem of medical errors is progressively getting worse.

18284,6133,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-returning-puerto-rico-to-spain/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In December 2017, word spread quickly via social media that the United States intends to return the territory of Puerto Rico to Spain after a report detailing such a plan was published in the Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Día. The report said the plan was the result of secret negotiations between the United States and Spain (translation ours): A hundred and nineteen years after the Treaty of Paris, which enabled the transfer of ownership of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, Madrid and Washington have virtually finalized an agreement to return the jurisdiction of the Caribbean island to the European country, endi.com sources have confirmed. The deal, which has been negotiated in secret for at least two years, is not yet official, but it has the approval of Presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Mariano Rajoy of Spain and certain technical details are all that remain to finalize. An announcement was expected before the end of the year, but it is possible that the emergence of last-minute complications will delay approval of the transfer until the first days of 2018. The agreement has to be approved by the US Congress, which was occupied until the last hours of his last session by federal tax reform and did not have time to address this issue. It was reported that the agreement has overwhelming support in Congress. 'This has long been done. Moreover, the United States should never have taken possession of Puerto Rico. It was a mistake. Puerto Rico has cost us too much, ' said Alabama Republican Sen. Luke McCullen. Whatever surface plausibility the article may have had stemmed from strained relations between the United States and Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The territory was devastated by the storm, which left millions without power and basic necessities for months. The Trump administration was criticized by many inside and outside Puerto Rico for what was termed an inadequate, too-slow response to the crisis. President Trump said the government's response compared favorably to that in past hurricanes and told Puerto Ricans the effort had thrown the federal budget 'out of whack.' Although El Nuevo Día is a reputable daily newspaper, a number of clues point to the information being false. For one, no such plan has been reported by any mainstream news outlets anywhere in the world but El Nuevo Día. For another, the agreement has not come up for public debate or voting in Congress, despite the claim that it 'enjoys overwhelming support' there. Additionally, there is no U.S. Senator from Alabama (or any other state) named Luke McCullen. (The article also names a fictional U.S. Ambassador to Spain, 'Cletus Ryder.' The actual ambassador, confirmed by the Senate in November 2017, is Duke Buchan.)

This is all so, though Bush still might remain ahead (perhaps way ahead) in money accumulated on behalf of a Republican. We won't know how much total cash has been stashed to help each candidate until PACs report again in 2016. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE - The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","Ted Cruz of Texas recently declared that his campaign's fundraising is 'astonishing' and suggested that's a surprise to the 'Washington chattering class' and maybe even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another Republican bidding for president. Sen. Cruz, appearing in Houston Oct. 26, 2015, to accept endorsements from statewide elected Republicans including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, celebrated how much he's raised in Texas and in general. He made us wonder with mention of the Texas-born Bush, who's trying to become the third member of his family to win the White House. Cruz said: 'And we finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field... $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign.' Cruz added that if he'd predicted such an outcome relative to Bush six months before, reporters would have laughed aloud. Early in 2015, Bush drew headlines for raising money at a vigorous clip. No giggling here. But was Cruz right about his campaign having the biggest pile of cash on hand and exceeding Bush's balance by $3.5 million? Campaign vs. campaign, you bet your cacti. But throw in money raised by PACs and Super PACs devoted to individual candidates and it could be there's far more money stowed away to boost Bush. Then again, PAC fundraising updates won't be filed until 2016. Campaign vs. campaign To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a list indicating that Cruz's campaign ended the year's third quarter, June through September 2015, with more cash on hand than any other Republican aspirant. Separately, we fetched a Federal Election Commission summary, dated Oct. 19, 2015, stating that through September 2015, Cruz's campaign had nearly $13.8 million cash on hand. And Cruz's balance, according to the document, exceeded the cash on hand of any of 15 other listed current or former Republican presidential candidates. At No. 2, retired surgeon Ben Carson had nearly $11.3 million cash on hand, according to the summary, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with nearly $11 million and Bush with nearly $10.3 million. To be precise, per Cruz's claim in Houston, Bush's cash on hand of $10,271,129 was a little more than $3.5 million less than Cruz's $13,778,904. We're not saying here that Cruz outraised everyone. According to another FEC summary, also dated Oct. 19, 2015, Carson raised some $31 million through September 2015, outpacing Cruz's nearly $27 million and Bush's nearly $25 million. Businessman Donald Trump, who has led many Republican voter polls, reported a scant $254,773 cash on hand through the third quarter. But Trump, who's wealthy, also has declared plans to self-fund his candidacy. Maybe how much cash he has on hand isn't significant. Also, Politico noted Oct. 15, 2015, Trump fielded about $3.7 million in donations in the third quarter. Notably too, Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each ended the quarter having raised more money and also having more cash on hand than any Republican. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, had nearly $33 million on hand, according to the FEC, and Sanders, a Vermont senator, had $27.1 million. PACs and Super PACs There's another wrinkle if you consider how much money PACs and Super PACs devoted to candidates may have in cash on hand. According to a chart built by the New York Times, last updated Oct. 16, 2015, Bush-backing PACs and Super PACs had $98.2 million cash on hand through June 2015. In contrast, Cruz PACs and Super PACs had $37.5 million cash on hand. We don't see a path to more recent balances; a footnote to the Times chart says most of these groups aren't required to file an updated report until Jan. 31, 2016. Separately, the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending, posted a chart in October 2015 showing Bush PACs and Super PACs fielding far more money than any other hopeful, again with information limited to what such groups had reported through June 2015: SOURCE: Web post, 'Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups,' Center for Responsive Politics, last updated Oct. 27, 2015 (accessed the same day) The chart is preceded by explanatory text: 'The modern presidential campaign isn't a single organization. Yes, there's always an official campaign committee. But for every White House candidate, there is usually at least one super PAC or other outside organization devoted to getting him or her elected. These groups can solicit unlimited donations and later use them to pummel rivals - or, as seems to be the case this cycle, take on some of the duties traditionally handled by a campaign, such as organizing town hall meetings or doing voter outreach.' The explanation continues: 'Outside groups aren't allowed to coordinate with official campaign committees, but they're often run by friends and former staffers - even family members - of the candidate they're helping. Overall, as of the middle of 2015, single-candidate super PACs in the presidential race had raised more money than the candidates themselves. But that wasn't true among Democrats, whose potential nominees raised more than the super PACs supporting them.' Frazier of Cruz's camp agreed by email it could be that money accumulated to promote Bush's candidacy still runs ahead of funds raised for Cruz's cause. Regardless, she reminded, Cruz limited his Houston claim to funds raised by campaigns alone.",,,,"My campaign 'finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field ... $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Video clips of President Obama speaking about eliminating Medicare fraud play are interspersed with still shots of the president embracing retirees. The text: 'As president he signed the Affordable Care Act ... and reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011.' We're checking whether the ad is accurate that the health law -- and Obama, by extension -- are to credit for that many Medicare recipients paying less for prescription drugs last year. The doughnut hole Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs for beneficiaries, has always contained a coverage gap. The plan pays for drugs up to a dollar amount, but then Medicare recipients must cover the entire cost of prescriptions until catastrophic coverage kicks in. Currently, beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D program must pay the first $310 for prescriptions. Then insurance then pays up to $2,830. At that point they're in what's known as the doughnut hole with a gap in coverage until they hit an out-of-pocket limit of $4,550. At that point, their coverage takes over again, usually paying about 95 percent of the costs. Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University, co-wrote a study for the Kaiser Family Foundation last year on the coverage gap. He pointed out that even those who reach the catastrophic threshold do so only after they have been paying the full price of their prescriptions for several months. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slowly phases out the doughnut hole through price discounts and government subsidies, eliminating it completely in 2020. The 2011 phase Last year, under the terms of the health care law, the doughnut hole shrank a little with those eligible for Medicare receiving discounts on drugs once they reached the coverage gap. Drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50 percent discount for covered brand name drugs, while there were federal subsidies (7 percent discount) for generic drugs, said Elizabeth Hargrave, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study with Hoadley. 'The brand-name drug discounts do not cause beneficiaries to reach the catastrophic coverage more slowly - they're counted as if beneficiaries paid these amounts out of pocket. So this is true savings even for beneficiaries who subsequently reach the catastrophic limit,' Hargrave added. Both discounts will increase over time until the doughnut hole is effectively closed in 2020, she said. So the reduced drug costs are real. What about the number of people who benefitted? 'Nearly 3.6 million Americans' The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that total discounts added up to $2.1 billion, or an average of $604 per beneficiary. It also said 3,576,640 people enjoyed those savings. (For a state-by-state breakdown, check out the chart at the bottom of the fact sheet.) The CMS numbers are based on 2011 Part D claims data received through Feb. 29, 2012, the agency said. We didn't see any reason to doubt the figures, but CMS is a federal agency under Obama, and this is an Obama campaign ad. So we ran it by Hoadley and Hargrave, who both said the 3.6 million figure checks out. Hargrave pointed us to another CMS chart, which totalled the number of beneficiaries in the doughnut hole in 2011 at 3,758,024 -- including the territories -- and about 3.6 million in the 50 states.

5023,210,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-president-trump-say-canadians-smuggle-shoes/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"United States President Donald Trump took another swipe at Canada on 19 June 2018 during a speech about 'smugglers' bringing shoes into the country from the United States, by mixing two pieces of a New York Post story. Trump, speaking at an event hosted by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), said: There was a story two days ago in a major newspaper talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive. The tariffs to get common items back into Canada are so high that they have to smuggle them in. They buy shoes and they wear them. They scuff them up to make them sound old, or look old. No, we're treated horribly. The president did not identify the 'major newspaper' that supposedly printed the story, but his statement was based on an op-ed published in the Post three days earlier by reporter Isabel Vincent. She wrote: A Canadian who once lived in Vancouver told me he would cross the border into Seattle to buy outdoor equipment that he simply couldn't find in Canada. 'Before we crossed back into Canada, we'd remove the price tags and make sure that the new equipment looked as dusty as possible,' he said. Vincent, who said Canadian friends relied on her to help them bring goods across the border, also shared an anecdote regarding shoes, though it did not involve changing their appearance: A Toronto-based designer I know purchased two pairs of shoes (retail $800 each) online from a midtown department store and shipped them to my office. The Italian contraband sat under my desk for weeks until I could entrust them to a carrier who would be crossing the border. I finally convinced my nephew who had been visiting New York to stuff them into his back-pack and rendezvous with the designer in Toronto for the drop-off. My friend saved $159.59 in combined federal and provincial taxes, and $187.26 in estimated customs charges. The NFIB did not respond to a request for comment concerning the remark. The Footware Distributors and Retailers of America, though, rebuked Trump for his comment in a statement. The trade group's president and CEO Matt Priest said that 'anyone from anywhere' was welcome to purchase shoes in the United States: The President seems misinformed about footwear trade. Consumers buying shoes in America already pay a very high tariff, upwards of 37.5 percent and 67.5 percent. NAFTA is not treating footwear consumers in America unfairly, the American government itself has not lowered footwear duties in a meaningful way in over 80 years. If the President is concerned about treating American footwear companies and consumers fairly, then he should have signed the TPP to lower footwear costs in America. Canada signed the TPP and will eventually get duty free shoes from Vietnam, a major sourcing hub, where American brands will ship directly into Canada duty free. Canadian's have no real reason to 'smuggle' their shoes because their government is already helping lower their costs through proper trade deals. The Canadian government does not identify any specific limitations on bringing American footwear into the country. Most goods worth more than 200 Canadian dollars are subject to duty and taxes if brought in more than 24 hours after purchase. Trump's remark was the latest in a series of verbal attacks against Canada and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, accusing the country of taking economic advantage of the U.S. He has also threatened that the U.S. would exit its partnership in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and did not discount that possibility in his remarks at the NFIB event, saying: We're trying to equalize it. It's not easy but we're getting there.

NAFTA is not treating footwear consumers in America unfairly, the American government itself has not lowered footwear duties in a meaningful way in over 80 years. If the President is concerned about treating American footwear companies and consumers fairly, then he should have signed the TPP to lower footwear costs in America. Canada signed the TPP and will eventually get duty free shoes from Vietnam, a major sourcing hub, where American brands will ship directly into Canada duty free.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, an old quotation attributed to the 16th-century German theologian Martin Luther gained prominence online, especially among Christians, as millions of people navigated the disruption and difficulty caused by the virus. In memes, social media posts, and blog posts published by various churches, roughly the same words were included, and the quotation was typically described as deriving from a letter Luther wrote to Johan Hess, in the context of the Black Death: Therefore I shall ask God to mercifully protect us. Then I shall fumigate, help purify the air, administer medicine and take it... If God should wish to take me, he will surely find me, and I have done what he expected of me. If my neighbor needs me, however, I shall not avoid person or place but will go freely. - Martin Luther. 'Whether One May Flee From a Deadly Plague.' That quotation was accurate, and was rightly attributed to Luther, a key figure in the Protestant Reformation who died in 1546. As such, we are issuing a rating of 'Correct Attribution.' However, the memes omitted parts of the same letter in which Luther warned Christians not to wantonly or needlessly risk their own health, and the health of others, stating that such behavior was morally equivalent to 'suicide' and 'murder.' The original source of Luther's musings about the bubonic plague that devastated Europe in the Middle Ages was his 1527 letter to a fellow Reformation leader. That summer and fall, according to a 1968 collection of Luther's writings, the plague badly affected the German city of Wittenberg, site of the university where Luther served as chair of the theology department. Two hundred miles to the east, in Breslau, now the city of Wrocław in modern-day Poland, Luther's fellow Reformationists debated whether it was appropriate for Christians to flee a bubonic plague hotspot, and wrote to Luther seeking his advice. His response came in the form of an open letter addressed to Johann Hess, a Reformation leader in Breslau. The letter can be read in its original German, here, and an English translation by Carl Schindler can be read in full here. It was finished around November 1527, and was turned into a widely-distributed 14-page pamphlet. In it, Luther encourages Christians who have a duty of care to others, like sick relatives or neighbors, to stay and tend to them. However, he advises that anyone without such responsibilities should flee the plague, rather than tempt God's wrath by unnecessarily risking exposure to it. The sections included in the widely-shared memes and online posts during COVID-19 can be found towards the end of the letter. As translated by Schindler, Luther wrote: You ought to think this way: 'Very well, by God's decree the enemy has sent us poison and deadly offal. Therefore I shall ask God mercifully to protect us. Then I shall fumigate, help purify the air, administer medicine, and take it. I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance infect and pollute others, and so cause their death as a result of my negligence. 'If God should wish to take me, he will surely find me and I have done what he has expected of me and so I am not responsible for either my own death or the death of others. If my neighbor needs me, however, I shall not avoid place or person but will go freely, as stated above...' [Emphasis is added]. It is striking that the memes and online posts shared widely in 2020 and 2021 conspicuously left out those passages from this section of Luther's letter that warned Christians not to needlessly risk exposing themselves or others to the plague. For example, the memes omitted the sentence which states 'I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance infect and pollute others.' Whether deliberate or not, the result of these omissions was likely to be that the reader would have the distorted impression that Luther's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic might have been to eschew social distancing, face-masking, and other mitigation strategies. In fact, earlier in the letter he issued a searing condemnation of those who wantonly risked their health, and the health of others, drawing a moral equivalence to 'suicide' and 'murder.' Luther wrote: They are much too rash and reckless, tempting God and disregarding everything which might counteract death and the plague. They distain the use of medicines; they do not avoid places and persons infected by the plague, but lightheartedly make sport of it and wish to prove how independent they are. They say that it is God's punishment; if he wants to protect them he can do so without medicines or our carefulness. This is not trusting God but tempting him. God has created medicines and provided us with intelligence to guard and take good care of the body so that we can live in good health. If one makes no use of intelligence or medicine when he could do so without detriment to his neighbor, such a person injures his body and must beware lest he become a suicide in God's eyes. By the same reasoning a person might forego eating and drinking, clothing and shelter, and boldly proclaim his faith that if God wanted to preserve him from starvation and cold, he could do so without food and clothing. Actually that would be suicide. It is even more shameful for a person to pay no heed to his own body and to fail to protect it against the plague the best he is able, and then to infect and poison others who might have remained alive if he had taken care of his body as he should have. He is thus responsible before God for his neighbor's death and is a murderer many times over.","Did Martin Luther Write of the Plague, 'I Shall Not Avoid Person or Place'?

Nevadans who get health insurance through the exchange will see their unsubsidized premium costs rise by about 12 percent (although most people in the exchange receive subsidies). Most counties in the state will only have one insurer on the exchange next year, but about 97 percent of enrollees live in a county with at least two insurers. Still, the basic facts are correct. We rate Trump's statement as Mostly True.","At a recent campaign rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump tried to connect the recent news of health care premium cost hikes next year to his target audience - Nevada voters. 'It's just been announced that the citizens of Nevada are going to experience a massive, massive -- in fact, I don't even want to tell you what the number is, I won't because you'll walk out of here depressed -- double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year,' he said. 'Ten of Nevada's 16 counties will have only Obamacare, and think of it, you can have one, exchange insurer that you can choose from. They are in a very good position to negotiate with you, aren't they?' Trump, who wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, threw out some pretty specific figures in terms of Nevada health care costs, making us curious as to how accurate he was. While he largely gets the numbers correct, Trump's rhetoric overstates the impact of rate hikes that Nevadans enrolled in the state's insurance market will face next year. A big league premium hike? Republicans across the country have seized on recent news that health care premium costs under President Barack Obama's healthcare law would increase by an average of 25 percent across the 39 states using the federal online marketplace, coupled with about 28 percent of insurers leaving the marketplace. The premium hikes for some plans in some states are striking: a Kaiser Family Foundation study cites a hypothetical 27-year-old in Arizona who could see the monthly cost of a 'second-lowest cost silver plan' jump from $196 to $422, or 116 percent. The average cost for a plan through Nevada Health Link, a state-managed website that uses the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace, is also going up. The state is on track for an average increase of about 12 percent for unsubsidized premium costs, which is the eleventh-lowest hike in the country. While a double-digit rise in premium costs is nothing to scoff at, Nevada Health Link spokeswoman Janel Davis said about 87 percent of Nevadans enrolled in an exchange plan receive a tax credit to help pay down insurance costs and that the subsidy should increase in lockstep with any rise in premium. Davis said it's difficult to calculate an average dollar increase in premium costs because the subsidy is dependent on a variety of factors including income, family size and age. Trump is also correct that most Nevada counties will only have one insurer, but he didn't get the number of counties in the state quite correct. Nevada has 16 standard counties and the independent Carson City, which is counted as the equivalent of a county by the exchange and census. An emailed version of Trump's prepared remarks cites 17 counties in the state, though the version on the campaign's website has 16. Regardless, a large percentage of Nevada counties (59 percent) only have one insurer to choose from. However, the majority of Nevadans enrolled through the exchange live in counties with more than one insurer. According to Kaiser more than 90 percent (79,000) of Nevadans enrolled in the exchange have at least three insurers to choose from, while only 3 percent (3,000) are enrolled in mostly rural counties with only one insurer. And unlike other states, none of the three insurers in Nevada are planning to leave the exchange marketplace in 2017. Nevada Republican Reps. Joe Heck, Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei have introduced a bill exempting counties with only one insurer from the individual mandate penalty, though the legislation hasn't moved forward since being introduced in September.",,,,Says Nevadans will have a 'double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year' and '10 of Nevada's 16 counties will only have one Obamacare...,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The state DCA points to Christie's property tax cap as reining in taxes during his tenure, without mentioning the impact of tax relief programs that have been reduced greatly in the past few years. But reduced or eliminated tax rebates means taxpayers generally have to pony up more money to pay their tax burdens. But a number of organizations have pointed to previous DCA figures showing a net property tax increase of nearly 20 percent. An Associated Press report said the actual increase for the first three years of Christie's gubernatorial tenure has been 13 percent, considering a variety of factors -- including estimates, rather than final numbers, for 2012. Given the disparity between NJ Spotlight's and the AP's figures, and factoring in past Truth-O-Meter fact-checks on this topic, it's clear the increase isn't as high as 20 percent, but it doesn't appear to be as low as 13 percent. Silva is right that property taxes have increased under Christie, but it's not as much as she said. As a result, we rate her claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: This story has been updated to clarify that NJ Spotlight is an online news site and is not considered liberal-leaning. NJ Spotlight can be accessed at www.njspotlight.com.","Chris Christie can cite numerous accomplishments during his time as New Jersey's governor, but it's one achievement in particular that has caught Milly Silva's attention. Silva, the lieutenant governor candidate on the Democratic slate challenging Christie in the Nov. 5 election, cited the Republican governor's 'achievement' on Oct. 7 while speaking at an American Legion in Little Ferry. 'Property taxes have increased 20 percent under four years of Chris Christie,' Silva said. That's some hike, and while Silva is correct that property taxes have gone up under Christie, it's not quite as much as she claims. To begin, let's review how action in Trenton can impact property tax bills. Although a governor is not directly responsible for increasing a community's property taxes, what he does to a state budget can impact what property owners pay. In Christie's case, he has cut aid in numerous areas to help balance the state budget. As the governor has noted on numerous occasions, he came into office in 2010 and had to deal quickly with a multibillion-dollar deficit. The gap was the result of factors from steep drops in state revenue during the recession (December 2007 to June 2009) to spending by previous administrations, experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey. To deal with the deficit, Christie cut education funding and numerous other line items in the budget, skipped a pension contribution and overhauled tax relief programs -- such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. Some New Jersey lawmakers -- including Assemblyman John McKeon, an Essex County Democrat -- have said the reduction in rebates led to a 20 percent increase in property taxes. Officials with the state Department of Community Affairs have rejected the idea that property taxes have climbed 20 percent. In the case of the EITC, for example, taxpayers now get a credit directly on their tax bill instead of the old practice, when the state sent rebate checks to taxpayers. Still, the original purpose of that check was for tax relief. Earlier this year the online news site NJ Spotlight released a study showing that the net property tax increase during Christie's first three years in office was approximately 18.5 percent. The net increase is the actual cost of property taxes for the average New Jerseyan after rebates are deducted. Citing data from the state Department of Community Affairs, NJ Spotlight noted that net property taxes in New Jersey rose from $6,244 in 2009 to $7,405 in 2012. Other organizations have cited similar figures. But a DCA spokeswoman told us that property taxes have not climbed 20 percent under Christie. She also pointed to the results of a cap the governor implemented in July 2010 that limits property tax growth to 2 percent annually, unless local voters approve exceeding the cap. 'Actually, average increases were less in the last three years than in the thirty years prior averaging approximately 2% each year and nothing close to 20%,' spokeswoman Tammori Petty said in an e-mail. 'Some communities even saw tax decreases depending on local leadership. These record low increases are far less than 20% real increase that did exist in previous administrations.' An Associated Press report last month reviewed DCA figures, tax levies and tax relief programs, finding that the actual property tax burden during Christie's first three years in office increased 13 percent -- not 20 percent. The AP said it used records from 2006 to 2012 on statewide property tax levies and all the state's property tax relief programs to calculate the average net property tax bill. It also noted that some of the numbers used in the calculations came from 2012 estimates provided by the state Treasury Department rather than final numbers. David Turner, spokesman for Buono's campaign, cited the NJ Spotlight report as well as a Star-Ledger editorial that agreed with the study's figures. 'It is undeniable that when property owners look at their bills they have seen a 20 percent increase under Governor Christie,' Turner said in an e-mail. 'His talk is cheap but tax policies are expensive for working and middle class families.' Kevin Roberts, spokesman for Christie's gubernatorial campaign, said Silva should instead review the fiscal actions of her running mate, noting that state Sen. Barbara Buono has voted for 154 tax and fee increases.

Share the Facts Politifact 2 7 Politifact Rating: Mostly True 'The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth.' Peter Roskam U.S. Representative in a speech at the City Club of Chicago Monday, March 6, 2017 03/06/2017 Read More info","Speaking at an event in Chicago earlier this month, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., was talking tax policy and the economy when he pointed to lackluster economic growth that occurred under former President Barack Obama. 'The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth,' Roskam said during a March 6 speech at the City Club of Chicago. It's an oft-cited figure Republicans tend to throw around to highlight the weak economic recovery throughout Obama's presidency, but does the data back it up? A familiar claim Roskam's claim lacks some specifics, particularly the type of growth and time frame he was referring to in his speech. David Pasch, the Wheaton Republican's communications director, provided a link to data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showing both the annual and quarterly percentage change in real gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total value of goods and services provided in the country. While annual figures on GDP growth date back to the Herbert Hoover administration and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the federal government did not start tracking quarterly growth until 1947. Considering the time frame for which this annual data is available, it's safe to assume Roskam was referring to economic growth since the Hoover administration. In fact, Roskam's claim is quite similar to a statement Donald Trump made during a campaign speech in October, which was fact-checked by our colleague Joshua Gillin at PolitiFact Florida. As was the case with Trump's claim, Roskam is right when he says that year-over-year GDP growth never topped 3 percent while Obama was in office. But as Princeton University economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact at the time, looking at annual data can be misleading because it doesn't provide context or account for historical factors that affect economic growth, such as recessions and global crises. For example, Hoover came into office on the cusp of the Great Depression, and Obama took over during the tail end of the Great Recession and amid instability in the Middle East. That's one of the main reasons why economists suggest looking at the percentage change in GDP by quarters, rather than growth in a single calendar year. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Trump saying Obama was the first president 'in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth,' data for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 was not yet available. But now it is. GDP growth in 2016 and the Obama years According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the percentage change in GDP growth during the third and fourth quarters of the last year of Obama's final term was 3.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, resulting in an average growth rate of 1.6 percent for 2016. That was down 1 percentage point from 2015 when GDP grew by 2.6 percent, which marked the best year for average growth under Obama. Typically, economic growth in the first quarter of a new presidency is attributed to the previous administration, meaning former President George W. Bush gets credit for the 5.4 percent contraction in the economy during the first three months of 2009. As for the remainder of Obama's time in office, quarterly GDP growth averaged 2.0 percent, or 1.5 percent when averaging out annual figures. But if the data is used to compare one quarter to the same quarter from a year ago, there were two periods during Obama's tenure in which growth exceeded 3 percent. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was about 3.1 percent; and between the first quarters of 2014 and 2015, the economy grew by 3.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With the way Roskam refers to growth, however, Obama indeed was the first president who did not achieve more than 3 percent growth in GDP. Average growth under Bush Sr., was 2.1 percent; 3.9 percent for Bill Clinton; 2.3 percent for George H.W. Bush; and 3.5 percent for Ronald Reagan. The highest annual growth on record occurred in 1942 during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, when GDP grew by a staggering 18.9 percent as the United States entered World War II and ramped up production following the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.",,,,'The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Harris believes this strategy is key to slowing what she claims is a dramatic rise in the nation's prison population. 'Over the last 40 years, this country's prison population has grown by 500 percent,' Harris said on her campaign website, and in a recent tweet that included a stark black and white picture of prison bars. 'We have a responsibility to ensure agencies focus on preventing crime -- not just fighting crime after the fact,' Harris added in the tweet. Harris is competing with U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer in November's election. All three are Democrats. We decided to check whether Harris stretched the truth in her claim about the rapid rise in America's prison population. Our research We relied on data from the Sentencing Project. The criminal justice advocacy group is considered a credible source for incarceration figures. Its data was cited by the national PolitiFact team in a recent fact check on a similar claim. The Sentencing Project's data show there are 2.2 million people in the nation's federal and state prisons and local jails -- a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent during that period. Available numbers from the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics agree with those from the Sentencing Project. Harris' claim is slightly different in that it cites the nation's spike in 'prison population' rather than a combined increase in prisons and jail figures. Some might read her statement as including both prison and jail inmates, but there's a significant difference between the two. To assess Harris' more limited claim, we examined the rise of the prison population alone. The Sentencing Project's data show the nation's prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. Unlike most politicians, it appears Harris understated her legitimate point. More background Harris' claim and stance on prison reform is significant given California's overcrowded prisons. At nearly 600,000 people, California has the second largest correctional population among states, behind only Texas' nearly 700,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Those figures include prison and jail inmates and people on probation and parole. Source: U.S. Justice Department Harris' claim centers on the rise of prison inmates over the past four decades. Over the past few years, however, America has seen a decline in prisoners. The nationwide total dropped about 100,000 from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sentencing Project. Reforms in California account for much of that drop, as the state has reduced its prison population by about 50,000 following a 2009 federal court order to do so, according to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California. In November, Californians will vote on Proposition 57, a measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown designed to ease the state's prison overcrowding. It would allow some offenders to be considered for parole earlier than now possible. A campaign spokesman said Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure.

That photograph first popped up online when it was posted to Twitter by Kate Kosturski in June 2017.

Although this Trump-inspired campaign may have not sat well with some consumers, Mark Sandys, the Global Head of Beer, Baileys and Smirnoff at Diageo (Smirnoff's parent company), asserted that the overall response to the promotion was positive: While other brands have taken some heat for going after Trump, Smirnoff got strong support, with an 86% positive to 14% negative rating, according to the brand's research, Diageo executives said in an interview at Cannes. 'That's way more positive than the response that we get for some of our LGBT work,' said Mark Sandys, who oversees Smirnoff. 'I think that says two things: Firstly how important it is to be doing LGBT work, and second that the threat level of the risk that we are taking on the America-Russia campaign is actually an acceptable risk to take.' Diageo global CMO Syl Saller opined that the advertisement probably worked as well as it did because it was just as much about Smirnoff as it was about President Trump: When tackling hot-button issues in marketing, 'it has to be true to the brand,' Saller said. 'If you are riding a wave of a topic and you have no right to comment on that topic you are going to lose. Because people smell when it is not true to the brand.' While Smirnoff had some trepidation about the Trump ads, it pressed forward because executives were confident it used the right tone.

20334,8696,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/isis-fatwa-kill-puppies/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In mid-December 2015, the web site What Does It Mean? published a story claiming that ISIS had issued a fatwa for the mass killing of American puppies: A chilling report issued by the Main Intelligence Directorate General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU) is warning today that the pet dogs and puppies of American owners have now become 'targets for death' after the Islamic State's (ISIS/ISIL/Daesh) top religious scholar, Turki al-Bin'ali, issued a fatwa authorizing the immediate mass slaughter of these beloved animals by their terrorist supporters currently residing in the United States. According to this report, this Islamic legal pronouncement (fatwa) issued by the Islamic State Caliphates main ideological-religious leader, who currently resides under the protection of the US at their Bahrain naval base (NSAB), was in response to queries from many of their younger American 'sympathizers/supporters' wanting to wage jihad but fearful of being captured or killed-or not being of sufficient age to 'obtain/purchase' weapons. Turki al-Bin'ali's response to these American followers, as outlined in his fatwa published earlier today in the Islamic State's online magazine Dabiq, this report continues, was that while although the main duty of jihad was to 'kill/destroy/main' as many infidels (non-believers/Christians/Jews, etc.) as possible, no matter what the cost, it is entirely acceptable, also, to strike fear into these Westerners by the mass murdering of their dogs and puppies. While What Does It Mean? claimed that the report came from Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU), we could find no record of the GRU's supposed warning. Similarly, WDIM? claimed that the fatwa was issued in the pages of an ISIS magazine called Dabiq. While Dabiq is a real magazine, the latest issue was more concerned with the Paris attacks than killing puppies. While the WDIM? article is full of links to additional reading material, none of these links direct the reader to information which could back up WDIM?'s claim. For instance, instead of linking to the General Staff of the Armed Forces' supposed warning about a fatwa for killing puppies, the link redirects people to a general page about the Russian military. Similarly, WDIM? linked to a general page about the magazine Dabiq instead of to proof that the most current issue contained the alleged fatwa. This is a common tactic among fake news purveyors. Articles with links appear to be more credible and since readers frequently forgo additional research, they are able to trick people into believing that all of their information has been properly sourced. In this case, What Does It Mean? provided no proof that Isis had issued a fatwa on the mass murder of American puppies. This isn't too surprising since a disclaimer on WDIM? warns readers that they should not assume that any information on the web site is accurate: You should not assume that this site is error-free or that it will be suitable for the particular purpose which you have in mind when using it. The web site goes on to say that some of its articles are completely fabricated: Some events depicted in certain articles on this website are fictitious and any similarity to any person living or dead is merely coincidental. Some other articles may be based on actual events but which in certain cases incidents, characters and timelines have been changed for dramatic purposes. Certain characters may be composites, or entirely fictitious. The claim that ISIS had issued a fatwa for the mass murder of puppies comes from an unreliable source that frequently publishes fictional material.","Has ISIS Issued a Fatwa to Kill Puppies?

The ad contains no voice-over, only sound effects as Romney's quotes pop onto the screen against a black background. The first says, 'I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.' The NRA wields enormous political power at the state and national levels, and conservative candidates crave its endorsement. It's startling to see a Republican contender distancing himself from the group, so we decided to delve into the ad's claim. Did Romney really say that? In short, yes, he did. But it was in 1994. Running for Senate in Massachusetts, Romney criticized his opponent, Democrat Ted Kennedy, for supporting a crime bill in Congress. Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions. According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue, Romney stressed that he supported the bill's ban on 19 different types of assault weapons -- which the NRA opposed. 'I don't line up with the NRA,' Romney said, according to the story. The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA, as Santorum's ad could suggest. Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didn't agree with the NRA's position. At the time, Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales. The NRA opposed that bill. His words since In 2002, while running for governor, Romney was still talking the gun control talk. In a debate comment captured in this YouTube video, Romney said, 'We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won't chip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety.' In fact, he expanded those protections in the state. In 2004, Gov. Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK-47 and Uzi. The NRA called the law 'ineffective and unnecessary.' By 2007, when he was making his first run for president, Romney's tone had begun to change. The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric: 'He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners. He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA -- though his campaign won't say when he joined. And Friday, at his campaign's request, top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the country's biggest gun shows. 'Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons, but he won't say whether he stands by the Brady Bill. And after the gun show tour, his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws.' The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August, 2006, just months before announcing his presidential candidacy. At the time his campaign touted his pro-gun efforts as governor, including his signing of an NRA-backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol-makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7, 2005, as 'The Right to Bear Arms Day' in Massachusetts to honor 'the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families, persons, and property and for all lawful purposes, including the common defense.' The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press. Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain. Romney said, 'My position on guns is the same position I've had for a long, long time. That position is that I don't line up a hundred percent with the NRA. I don't see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue.' He said he still supported banning weapons that are 'unusually lethal' but hedged on waiting periods. He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks. Now that technology enables instant background checks, such waiting periods are unnecessary, he said. Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights. 'We should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA, I'm a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don't,' he told Russert. The 2012 campaign Romney didn't attend the NRA's national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message. He said nothing about gun rights. He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government. 'I believe in America. I believe in free enterprise,' he said. Romney's campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights. It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor. Instead, it touts his work on behalf of gun owners, including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free. 'As president, Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt, shoot, and protect their families, homes and property, and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment,' the website says. We contacted the NRA for this story but didn't hear back. The group has not endorsed any primary candidate -- which isn't unusual. It didn't announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008. But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama. Christopher Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that 'any of these (Republican) candidates would be a lot better than this president. ... So we take any of them over this guy.' Our ruling Santorum's ad flashes a quote from Romney saying 'I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.' The quote is accurate, though it omits the fact that Romney spoke those words 18 years ago and used them to describe his position on a single issue. Romney clearly has shifted his position on the issue of gun rights to align himself more closely with the NRA. For one thing, he became a member. And in campaigns subsequent to that 1994 senatorial bid, he has emphasized his work in favor of gun ownership rather than on tightening laws. But when Romney addressed the issue in 2007, he did not contradict what he said in 1994. 'I support the work of the NRA, I'm a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don't,' he told Tim Russert. What else? He signed an assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA as Massachusetts governor. We rate the statement True.

It was built by the USA in 1818 on Lake Champlain to protect the USA from British / Canadian attacks. After spending 2 years & $275,000, surveyors discovered a problem: The fort was built on the wrong side of the border.' The story relayed in this meme is largely accurate. The United States truly did build a base in the early 1800s that ended up being on the wrong side of the border. This fortress was never officially named but it has been known as 'Fort Blunder' for nearly two centuries. The saga of Fort Blunder was mentioned in this excerpt published in London's The Champion and Weekly Herald in 1839: Sun, Apr 14, 1839 - 5 · The Champion and Weekly Herald (London, Greater London, England) · Newspapers.com The United States got a second crack at building this fortress in 1842, when the Webster-Ashburton Treaty was signed to resolve various border issues and placed the land under the ruinous 'Fort Blunder' into American hands. The United States then built a second base that was officially named Fort Montgomery. Although not a slipup on the order of Fort Blunder, Fort Montgomery also saw little military action and would eventually be abandoned and fall to ruin. The above-displayed image shows the remnants of Fort Montgomery. In 1926, the Windsor Star published an article about how the United States built Fort Blunder on the wrong side of the border, how it was abandoned and fell to ruins, how a treaty placed the land in American hands, how it was rebuilt as Fort Montgomery in the 1840s, how it was again abandoned, and how it eventually became a tourist destination. Thu, Nov 18, 1926 - 26 · The Windsor Star (Windsor, Ontario, Canada) · Newspapers.com For a more modern take at the history of Fort Blunder, here's an excerpt from the New England Historical Society's page on the matter: In 1818, work began on a modern, heavy fortification at the northern end of Lake Champlain. The British had launched massive invasions of the United States through the lake during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. As a result, some of the hottest fighting took place in the region during both wars... To prevent that from happening again, President James Madison ordered the fort built. The State of New York helped out by ceding to the federal government a tiny spit of land called Island Point. The state also gave up 400 acres for a military reservation. Joseph Totten, later chief engineer of the U.S. Army, supervised construction of the octagonal, 30-foot-tall structure. It would have 125 cannons, and any British ship sailing past would come under heavy fire. Then, two years and $275,000 later, surveyors discovered a problem: The fort was being built on the wrong side of the border... All work stopped on the fort, and the heretofore unnamed citadel earned the nickname Fort Blunder. As of this writing, fans of U.S. History, New York real estate, or just folks looking to make a mistake, can purchase the remnants of Fort Montgomery and the land its on for just under $1 million.

The announcement sparked a flurry of messages on social media, with some arguing that pulling the movie for its depiction of race was hypocritical, even though it was the vehicle that led to the first Academy Award for a Black actress, Hattie McDaniel. Today is Hattie McDaniel's birthday. The first black woman to win an Acadeny Award for her role as 'Mammy' in 'Gone With The Wind.' Also today, @hbomax decided you should no longer be able to watch her achievement. pic.twitter.com/gzXrauLFHm - Chris Stigall (@ChrisStigall) June 10, 2020 Others noted, however, that while McDaniel was the first Black person to win an Oscar, her win at the 1940 Academy Awards was somewhat overshadowed by the fact that she was forced to sit in the back of the room where the event was hosted, separate from her white co-stars. The 12th Academy Awards were held at Coconut Grove Nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel on Feb. 29, 1940. 'Gone With the Wind' was the most nominated film of the night, and the movie's white stars were seated at a table near the main stage. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the Cocoanut Grove had a strict 'no blacks' policy, and that McDaniel was only allowed to be inside the building after David Selznick, the movie's producer, called in to request a special favor: The 12th Academy Awards were held at the famed Cocoanut Grove nightclub in The Ambassador Hotel. McDaniel arrived in a rhinestone-studded turquoise gown with white gardenias in her hair ... McDaniel then was escorted, not to the Gone With the Wind table - where Selznick sat with de Havilland and his two Oscar-nominated leads, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable - but to a small table set against a far wall, where she took a seat with her escort, F.P. Yober, and her white agent, William Meiklejohn. With the hotel's strict no-blacks policy, Selznick had to call in a special favor just to have McDaniel allowed into the building (it was officially integrated by 1959, when the Unruh Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in California). The 2008 book 'African Americans and the Oscar: Decades of Struggle and Achievement' noted that McDaniel was the first Black actor to attend an Academy Awards banquet, but also noted that the award-winning actress was relegated to a table in the back of the room: The Academy Awards ceremony took place at the Coconut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on February 29, 1940. Hattie was the first African American attendee at an Academy banquet. She was relegated to sitting with her escort at a rear table away from the Caucasion attendees, but Hattie was too much of the consummate professional to complain.

As Fay Bainter presents the award, the camera cuts to show prominent white actors in the crowd, but McDaniel is nowhere to be seen: The above-displayed video from the Oscars YouTube channel also omits McDaniel's approach to the stage. We've reached out to the Academy to see if the full video (or any photographs of McDaniel's table are archived) and will update this article if more information becomes available. It should also be noted that McDaniel was not invited to the premiere of 'Gone With the Wind' in 1939. The premiere was held in Atlanta, Georgia, which at the time had strict segregation laws. Selznick attempted to get some of the Black actors who worked on the film, including McDaniel, invited to the premiere, but MGM studios advised against it because she would not have been allowed to sit in the theater with her white co-stars. Here's a relevant excerpt from a 2010 biography of Clark Gable: Among other cast members flown in were Ona Munson, Laura Hope Crews, Evelyn Keyes, and Ann Rutherford. None of the black actors were represented. David Selznick had at least attempted to bring Hattie McDaniel, but MGM advised him not to because of Georgia's segregationist laws, which would have required McDaniel to stay in a colored-only hotel and prevented her from sitting in the theater with her white peers.

'Epstein dies while in custody, his private banker is found dead, a judge had a trial regarding Epstein and the Deutsche Bank,' reads a recent Facebook post. 'Her son has been killed now and her husband has been shot. The shooter who shot the son and shot the judge's husband has now also been found dead. Why is this not news?!' This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Epstein's 'private banker' who was found dead seems to be a reference to Thomas Bowers, who committed suicide in November 2019, according to the Los Angeles County medical examiner. Bowers was a former Deutsche Bank executive who 'reportedly signed off on some of the institution's unorthodox loans to Donald Trump,' Los Angeles Magazine reported. Bowers was once the head of the bank's American wealth-management division, where he oversaw Trump's private banker. The article doesn't mention Epstein. But Epstein, a financier, has close ties to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank recently agreed to pay a $150 million fine for its dealings with Epstein, the New York Times reported in a July article titled: 'These are the Deutsche Bank executives responsible for serving Jeffrey Epstein.' The bank itself hasn't publicly identified the individuals who worked with Epstein but based on descriptions of the employees in a consent order with the New York Department of Financial Services, and interviews with current and former bank officials, the Times identified nearly everyone in the legal document, according to the story. Paul Morris, who had previously helped Epstein manage an account at JPMorgan, brought Epstein to Deutsche Bank, the Times reported. Because Morris needed approval for a client who carried a reputational risk - Epstein had been convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor - he sent a memo to Charles Packard, then the head of the bank's American wealth-management division that detailed Epstein's past. Other bank officials are mentioned in the article but not Bowers. We found no credible sources corroborating the Facebook post's claim that Bowers was Epstein's 'private banker.' Deutsche Bank also connects Epstein to Judge Esther Salas, a federal judge whose son was killed and her husband injured in a shooting at their New Jersey home in July. Salas has presided over a class action lawsuit brought against the bank by investors who claim it made false and misleading statements about its anti-money laundering policies, according to the Associated Press, and because it failed to monitor 'high-risk' customers like Epstein. The lawyer suspected in the shooting at Salas' home was Roy Den Hollander, a self-described 'anti-feminist' who had compiled a dossier on her and her family and arrived at their home that morning carrying a FedEx package. 'He was apparently angry at Judge Salas for not moving quickly enough on a lawsuit he had brought challenging the constitutionality of the male-only draft,' according to the Times. Days before the shooting at Salas' residence, Hollander had traveled to San Bernardino County, Calif., where authorities say he shot and killed a rival men's rights lawyer at his home. Hollander later killed himself. We rate this Facebook post False.",,,,"'Epstein dies while in custody, his private banker is found dead, a judge had a trial regarding Epstein and the Deutsche Bank.

The campaign estimates it will cut taxes an average of $1,400 for 7-million seniors. It's worth noting that Obama's proposal has been criticized on several fronts. Some economists have questioned whether it's a wise policy because seniors already receive favorable tax treatment. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research group, said Obama's plan would create inequity by eliminating taxes for senior citizens who earn a modest income but continuing to tax younger workers earning the same amount. Also, it would help seniors who are currently paying income taxes but provide no benefit for those too poor to owe any tax. Still, Obama accurately describes his plan in the ad.

She purported he owns stock in Thermo-Fisher Scientific, which produces a machine necessary for the test: According to the Associated Press, Donald Trump, the current President of the United States who is supposed to be managing the Coronavirus epidemic and how the testing is conducted, has listed investments in V.F. Corp (VFC) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation (TMO) ... There is reason to believe that Donald Trump stands to profit from medical testing of coronavirus that will now take place in the United States. Though Vanderpool later updated her post to reflect that Trump currently owns no stocks in Thermo-Fisher, the claim of a potential conflict of interest continues to be repeated online. The CDC's COVID-19 test does indeed require a machine made by a company owned by Thermo-Fisher, Applied Systems. Official CDC testing guidelines specifically require an Applied Biosystems '7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR System with SDS 1.4 software.' In other words, both the PCR system and software are produced by Thermo-Fisher. Vanderpool cited a 2016 Associated Press story as evidence that Trump owned shares of Thermo-Fisher. While his ownership of Thermo-Fisher shares was accurate at the time, the president's financial-disclosure forms indicate he sold those shares sometime in 2017. Financial disclosures from 2016 and 2017 (each of which reflect the preceding financial year) indicated the president owned '$50,001-$100,000' worth of Thermo-Fisher stock in 2015 and 2016. Financial disclosures filed in 2018 and 2019, however, indicate that the president has not owned stock in Thermo-Fisher since the 2017 financial year. Although Trump has refused to release his tax returns and has not necessarily been transparent about all of his finances, the evidence used to support the claim that he could benefit financially from the new COVID-19 test is categorically flawed.

John McCain has long been known as a flag-carrier for earmark reform. And his hard line against pork projects has often put him at odds with fellow Arizona lawmakers trying to make sure that Arizona got its fair share. But McCain's principled stance also makes for rich campaign ad material. In a McCain attack ad on J.D. Hayworth, his Republican opponent in the Arizona primary, an announcer says that while McCain 'wages a determined battle against pork barrel spending,' J.D. Hayworth as a U.S. Congressman from Arizona from 1995 to 2007 was 'described as an 'avid earmarker,' and supported thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars before we voted him out of office.' The ad then runs a list of earmarks contained in bills that Hayworth voted for, and that McCain voted against. We picked two of them to put this issue into some context: * $220,000 to renovate Maine blueberry farm * $5.8 million for Vermont snowmobile trail The first earmark was part of a $375 billion Omnibus appropriations bill passed by Congress in 2004. According to a conference report attached to the bill, it did indeed include, '$220,000 for the University of Maine (Jonesboro and Orono), Blueberry Hill Farm to renovate the blueberry research facility.' The shorthand in the McCain ad is perhaps one part hyperbole -- calling it money for a blueberry farm rather than money for a university-run blueberry research facility. But it's close enough. The bill passed the House 242-176; and Hayworth voted for it. The bill passed the Senate comfortably as well, 65-28. McCain voted against it and was very clear that it was because of the hundreds of earmarks it contained. 'It appears that the big spenders in this body have all but stolen the credit card numbers of every hard-working taxpayer in America and have gone on a limitless spending spree for parochial pork-barrel projects, leaving Americans to pay and pay,' McCain said from the floor of the Senate at the time. The second project, for the snowmobile trail, was tucked into a $286 billion highway and mass transit bill that passed in 2006. In addition to paying for the interstate highway system and other federal highway programs, the bill included more than 6,000 earmarks (including the now infamous 'Bridge to Nowhere' in Alaska) worth a total of about $24 billion. According to a committee report attached to the bill, it included $5.8 million for 'construction of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail for the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers.' The bill passed overwhelmingly: 412 to 8 in the House (Hayworth voted for it); and 91 to 4 in the Senate. McCain, who voted against it, called the bill a 'monstrosity' and added, 'It would seem that this Congress can weather any storm thrown at it, as long as we have our pork lifesaver to cling to.' So there's no question Hayworth voted for bills that included the two earmarks from McCain's campaign ad. But is it fair to call Hayworth an 'avid earmarker' (a moniker given to Hayworth in a Feb. 21, 2010, opinion piece from the Arizona Republic's Robert Robb) and to say that he supported those particular projects? Hayworth addressed the ad's claims via a video response on his campaign website. Hayworth said the McCain campaign is 'playing a cynical Washington game.' 'They took an appropriations bill in a huge area, let's say for example in an area like transportation, and they highlighted controversial provisions in that appropriations bill,' Hayworth said. 'Now understand, when you serve in the U.S. Congress or the Senate, you don't have the luxury of saying, 'Well, I like this particular provision but not the other one.' In other words, you vote for that transportation bill either up or down.' Hayworth is right that those particular earmarks -- for the blueberry farm and snowmobile trail -- never came up for an up or down vote on their own merits. They were included in massive appropriations bills and represented a minuscule fraction of the overall bills. While it's impossible to say whether Hayworth supported the particular earmarks cited in the McCain ad, it is fair to say he was okay with the process. A July 29, 2005, press release issued by his congressional office boasts that 'Rep. Hayworth was able to earmark millions of dollars in the (transportation) bill for specific projects in his district, as requested by local elected officials and state transportation officials.' A March 31, 2004, story in the Arizona Republic detailed $52.5 million worth of earmarks for Arizona folded into a $275 billion transportation bill. And Hayworth defended them. 'Call it earmarks, call it authorized projects, call it pork or whatever,' Hayworth told the Arizona Republic. 'The fact is, these projects reflect the priorities of local and state officials to help our transportation infrastructure keep pace with the extraordinary growth we are experiencing in the East Valley.' Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington advocacy group that tracks earmarks, said voting for the appropriations bills was an endorsement of the process, and therefore all the earmarks in them. 'At the end of the day, if you have to hold your nose and vote for a bill, then you have to deal with the fallout,' Ellis said. 'If everybody just goes along to get along, the status quo remains,' Ellis said. 'If enough people stand up and fight, that's how you effect change.' We think it is misleading to suggest that Hayworth specifically supported the blueberry farm and snowmobile trail projects in those massive appropriations bills. In fact, we doubt he even knew those particular projects were even in the bill. But Hayworth knew the bills contained billions in earmarks, and he even boasted in a press release about some of the earmarks he included for Arizona. From where we sit, if you boast to constituents about the earmarks you brought to your home state, then you've got to live with the earmarks other legislators brought to theirs.

Those surplus funds were credited to the Social Security trust fund. By the end of 2010, the trust fund totaled $2.6 trillion. Last year, Social Security began to run a cash flow deficit. Costs exceeded tax revenues, for reasons that included the recession and its high unemployment. Social Security dipped into the trust fund to make up the difference. Social Security's trustees projected that the fund would fully cover benefits through 2035, the Congressional Research Service notes, and that it would cover about 77 percent of benefits after that until 2085. Taking action like increasing the payroll tax or lifting the level of income subject to the tax above its current limit of $106,800 would keep the fund fully solvent for the entire 75 years. And this is where money meets myth, cash flow meets credit and true meets false. The trust fund is not a savings account or 'lock box' into which cash is deposited. Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-bearing government bonds -- Treasury securities backed by the U.S. government. They are IOUs -- assets to Social Security but liabilities to the rest of government. They're one part of government promising to pay back another. Once invested, the trust fund money is mingled with money from other sources of revenue in the U.S. Treasury general fund, and it is used for other government purposes that include spending, repaying debts or cutting taxes. For years, the infusion of Social Security's surplus revenue held down the federal deficit -- and, some say, encouraged spending. When Social Security operates with a negative cash flow -- that is, when benefits exceed revenues -- it draws on interest from the trust fund securities. To pay that interest and honor its IOUs to the trust fund, when the rest of the federal budget is operating at a deficit, the government has to borrow money. That contributes to the deficit -- even though Social Security is legally drawing on the surplus that was collected from its dedicated tax, and even though the Congressional Research Service says that 'government borrowing from the public is not clearly linked to any particular aspect of what the government does.' Kucinich was accurate in saying that Social Security didn't cause the debt crisis. If anything, Social Security delayed it by subsidizing other spending and reducing the need to borrow money elsewhere. On the books, the Social Security trust fund has credits approaching $2.6 trillion. Social Security's negative cash flow has begun to contribute a relatively small amount to the federal deficit, however, because Treasury has to borrow to cover the trust fund money that has been spent elsewhere. That is a recent development, and that information provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich's claim Mostly True.

The plan, intended as a trade to win Republican support for increases in tax revenue, drew criticism from Democrats that included Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland. Kucinich said on the House floor July 15, 2011, that Social Security was being falsely thrown into the debate, and that reducing benefits or raising the retirement age would only 'give government more money for tax cuts, spending or repaying the debt.' 'Social Security didn't cause the debt crisis. Social Security had nothing to do with the debt crisis,' he said. PolitiFact Ohio asked Kucinich's office how he backed up his statement. They referred us to 'Social Security: The Trust Fund,' a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. We also discovered that similar statements about Social Security and the debt crisis were previously checked by PolitiFact, and by our colleagues at Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker. Unfortunately, we found that they rated the statements true, not true and 'true but false' -- and that their stories were followed by notes about 'our angry readers' and stepping on a live wire. Let's take deep breath and walk through it. Social Security is a government program funded primarily by dedicated payroll taxes. It's called a pay-as-you-go system because current revenues are used to pay current costs.

Social Security's trustees projected that the fund would fully cover benefits through 2035, the Congressional Research Service notes, and that it would cover about 77 percent of benefits after that until 2085. Taking action like increasing the payroll tax or lifting the level of income subject to the tax above its current limit of $106,800 would keep the fund fully solvent for the entire 75 years. And this is where money meets myth, cash flow meets credit and true meets false. The trust fund is not a savings account or 'lock box' into which cash is deposited. Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-bearing government bonds -- Treasury securities backed by the U.S. government. They are IOUs -- assets to Social Security but liabilities to the rest of government. They're one part of government promising to pay back another. Once invested, the trust fund money is mingled with money from other sources of revenue in the U.S. Treasury general fund, and it is used for other government purposes that include spending, repaying debts or cutting taxes. For years, the infusion of Social Security's surplus revenue held down the federal deficit -- and, some say, encouraged spending. When Social Security operates with a negative cash flow -- that is, when benefits exceed revenues -- it draws on interest from the trust fund securities. To pay that interest and honor its IOUs to the trust fund, when the rest of the federal budget is operating at a deficit, the government has to borrow money. That contributes to the deficit -- even though Social Security is legally drawing on the surplus that was collected from its dedicated tax, and even though the Congressional Research Service says that 'government borrowing from the public is not clearly linked to any particular aspect of what the government does.' Kucinich was accurate in saying that Social Security didn't cause the debt crisis. If anything, Social Security delayed it by subsidizing other spending and reducing the need to borrow money elsewhere. On the books, the Social Security trust fund has credits approaching $2.6 trillion. Social Security's negative cash flow has begun to contribute a relatively small amount to the federal deficit, however, because Treasury has to borrow to cover the trust fund money that has been spent elsewhere. That is a recent development, and that information provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich's claim Mostly True.

Clinton's Wall Street reform plan does not say it would reimpose Glass-Steagall, and she's repeatedly downplayed the idea that it should be revived. However, Clinton argues that her alternative course would be more comprehensive and effective than simply reimposing the old law. O'Malley's claim is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.","In a recent appearance on Comedy Central's Daily Show, Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley doubled down on prior attacks on Hillary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street. While O'Malley charged Clinton with flip-flopping on a variety of issues close to progressives' hearts, he said she hasn't cut ties to Wall Street, which is based in New York, a state she used to represent in the Senate. O'Malley said Clinton doesn't have the 'independence' to protect Main Street from the excesses of big banks. 'There were many things that she changed positions right before the debate... whether it was the Trans-Pacific Partnership or whether it was Keystone,' O'Malley said on Oct. 19. 'But she couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking from the speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall, because she can't.' We decided to take a closer look at O'Malley's claim that Clinton 'couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall.' First, a refresher on the Glass-Steagall Act: It was passed in the wake of the Great Depression to keep commercial banking and investment banking separate, as a way of protecting the broader economy from the downside of speculation. As we noted in a previous fact-check, the law was whittled down over the years, until President Bill Clinton fully repealed it in 1999. Since the most recent financial crisis hit, reining in big banks and other financial institutions has been a rallying cry for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But is it true that Clinton doesn't echo that cry? For starters, Clinton's formal Wall Street reform plan doesn't include reinstating Glass-Steagall or reintroducing its provisions. Based on her recent comments, as cited by both the O'Malley and Clinton camps, that's because she thinks reinstatement of Glass-Steagall is a red herring. Here are a few examples: • July 23 at a campaign event in South Carolina: When asked why her economic policy doesn't include reinstating Glass-Steagall, Clinton responded, 'This is a much more complicated issue than to point at any one piece of legislation and say if we just pass that, everything would be fine. Our first goal has to be to implement fully and effectively Dodd-Frank,' referring to the landmark act signed by President Barack Obama that created a consumer protection agency and imposed regulations on financial institutions. • Sept. 29 in an interview with actress and writer Lena Dunham: 'Some people say all we have to do is break up the banks. Well, the problem with that is, the banks did their fair share of trouble, but a lot of the problems were not from these traditional banks. They were from what's called the shadow banking world. ...So I think we've got to be more comprehensive.' • Oct. 6 at the first Democratic primary debate: 'Well, my plan is more comprehensive (than reinstating Glass-Steagall). And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail.' • Oct. 8 in a column for Bloomberg: 'One serious approach being advocated is to pass an updated Glass-Steagall Act, separating commercial and investment banking, to reduce the size of the banks and the risk of a taxpayer bailout. I certainly share the goal of never having to bail out the big banks again, but I prefer the path of tackling the most dangerous risks in a different way.' • Oct. 16 at a town hall in Keene, N.H.: 'I fully respect my colleagues who have said let's reinstate Glass-Steagall. And if I thought that alone would prevent the potential next crisis, I'd raise my hand and join, but that's not my assessment. ...Glass-Steagall wouldn't do anything about it, if it were reinstated tomorrow.' In short, Clinton has tip-toed around the issue. She's expressed skepticism that reimposing Glass-Steagall, or something close to it, would solve the problems stemming from financial regulation. However, she argues that attacking the problem differently - for example, by imposing a 'risk fee' on the financial institutions with assets over $50 billion, regulations on the 'shadow banking' sector (i.e. hedge funds) and guidelines for prosecuting financial wrongdoing - would actually be a more effective response.",,,,"Says Hillary Clinton 'couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The posted photograph is authentic, and the caption accompanying it does describe a real event, but the two don't match: the rubber ducks shown in the image are not the infamous Pacific Ocean 'friendly floatees.' The above-displayed picture was taken by photographer Cassie Marshall at the Ken-Ducky Derby, an annual rubber duck race held in Louisville, Kentucky: A few months ago I entered some of my photos in the Capture Kentuckiana Project. The project involved local amateur and professional photographers submitting their work to be viewed by the Courier-Journal staff as well as each other. Photos were voted upon and out 11,688 photos submitted 144 were chosen for the book. The book is a representative of Kentuckiana. I won $50 and second place for a photo I submitted in the 'News and Events' category! The photo was 'Rubber Duck Sea'. Funny enough it is one of my least favorite photos I submitted (yet it seems to be my most popular on here too), but I supposed I shouldn't be picky. I'm pretty proud of my accomplishment nonetheless because I was able to get my name out around Louisville as a photographer. Hopefully this will lead to bigger and better things! Although Marhsall's photo did not capture a group of rubber ducks 'lost at sea,' the gist of the caption used by AsapScience is true. In 1992, a shipping crate carrying more than 25,000 bath toys (including ducks, beavers, blue turtles and green frogs) spilled into the Pacific Ocean, creating a group of Friendly Floatees that have inspired children's books, Disney movies, and helped oceanographers locate the North Pacific Gyre: Perhaps the most famous Floatees, though, are the some 2,000 of them that still circulate in the currents of the North Pacific Gyre - a vortex of currents that stretches between Japan, southeast Alaska, Kodiak, and the Aleutian Islands that the plight of the duckies helped to identify. 'We always knew that this gyre existed. But until the ducks came along, we didn't know how long it took to complete a circuit,' said (Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a retired oceanographer and Floatee enthusiast). 'It was like knowing that a planet is in the solar system but not being able to say how long it takes to orbit.

In contrast to those cities, though, 'San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry.' The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain. The San Antonio Express-News credited the city's rise to reasons 'including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care' in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story. Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken's 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas' only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood. Texas' rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University's Real Estate Center: 'Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better.' A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken's chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that 'Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking.' Our ruling San Antonio hasn't just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it's been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities. Castro's statement rates True.","Second-term San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro did not shy from celebrating his hometown during his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. Addressing the delegates assembled in Charlotte, N.C., Castro said that San Antonio residents recognize the value of investing in pre-Kindergarten and student college loans. 'We're investing in young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorow,' Castro said. 'And it's paying off. Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy.' Castro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we've previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city's investments in infrastructure and education paid off 'late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute.' Indeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken's 2011 list of the nation's best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession. The economic think tank's annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for 'more than a decade,' was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as 'a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs.' Milken's 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there.

News reports in 2018 said the CDC was planning to shrink its operations to help foreign countries prevent infectious diseases because it didn't expect to receive new funding once the supplement it received in 2014 ran out. But the programs didn't shut down in the end. The spending bill that lawmakers ultimately passed that year provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump's budget request originally asked for. Behar corrected her statement. We rate it False.,"Joy Behar, a co-host of ABC's 'The View,' accused President Donald Trump of dismantling anti-pandemic programs the Obama administration set up across the globe. Barack Obama 'set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus, exactly,' Behar said during the March 9 episode of the show. 'Do you know that Trump closed 37 of them?' The TV host's claim is wrong, and it's not entirely clear how she got her numbers, either. Trump did fail to replace top national-security officials in charge of coordinating the U.S. response to pandemics, and he unsuccessfully sought to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But he never slashed the programs Behar was referring to, however. As the Washington Post noted, there were concerns among global-health leaders that U.S. funding for an initiative known as the Global Health Security Agenda was running out, and that some U.S.-run pandemic-prevention programs would have to be downsized as a result. But the Trump administration never pulled the plug on those programs, although it did propose smaller budgets. Congress has injected more money into them in recent budget requests. One day after we reached out to ABC for comment, Behar made a tongue-in-cheek correction on air. 'The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries,' Behar said. 'I'm happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isn't that good?' Why the CDC thought its programs had to shrink The CDC has been operating public-health programs in a number of foreign countries as part the Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States helped launch in 2014. The initiative - which now includes 67 countries - is a global effort to help countries reduce the risk of infectious diseases. The bulk of its early funding came from a one-time, five-year emergency spending bill that Congress approved in late 2014 to respond to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC 'to support national public health institutes and global health security.' The CDC had hoped those funds would be replenished once the five-year supplement expired in October 2019, according to reports. But as the expiration date approached, it looked like the agency could be left with just the core annual budget to pull from. National news outlets reported in the spring of 2018 that the CDC was bracing for a possible funding drop-off. The CDC planned to scale back operations in 39 of 49 countries and focus on 10 'priority countries,' according to emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. In the end, however, Congress provided enough funding to sustain the programs, experts told us. (The White House and CDC did not respond to our requests for comment. The CDC told Factcheck.org it 'did not have to cut back its work' to 10 countries.) 'The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives,' added Claire Standley, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security. 'In the end, that didn't happen.' The worry in early 2018 was that the budget for the CDC's global disease-prevention programs would be just over $50 million, as it had been in past years, when the supplement from 2014 was still the primary funding source. Trump's 2018 budget proposal put it in that ballpark. But the budget Congress ultimately passed bumped the appropriations for 'global disease detection and other programs' up to $108.2 million. The same amount was provided in 2019. In November 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services pledged an additional $150 million 'to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world' at a meeting in which the U.S. affirmed its commitment to the next phase of the Global Health Security Agenda. The Trump administration's 2021 budget request appropriated $225 million for the same global-health programs, up from $183.2 million in 2020. As we've reported, Trump has consistently proposed cuts to certain CDC budgets, but the bills Congress ultimately passed - with Trump's signature - have steadily increased funding for the CDC's infectious-disease activities. Experts said the administration's wavering support has likely made it difficult for the CDC to plan out its activities. 'I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate,' Standley said. 'But I do think that the Trump administration, in failing to provide consistent funding and clear indication of the priority placed on global health security capacity building, has made it difficult for the CDC to sustain the programs and successful efforts put into place since 2014.' 'Programs weren't shut down in the end, but you can also say that the administration didn't prioritize them in the proposed budget,' added Jennifer Nuzzi, an associate professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. A problem with the numbers It's not clear why Behar referred to a shutdown of 37 of 47 programs when the 2018 news reports said the CDC was considering scaling back 39 of 49 operations. It's possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump 'shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs' was debunked by other fact-checkers. But however you crunch the numbers, it's hard to get to 47 countries - or 49, for that matter. Trump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus. He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics. He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs. Trump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one.- Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 25, 2020 A 2019 annual report on the Global Health Security Agenda says the CDC provides financial support and technical assistance to 17 priority countries, plus technical assistance for 14 countries and CARICOM, a group of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies. One CARICOM country is Haiti, which is already listed among the countries receiving technical assistance from the CDC. Another is Montserrat, a British territory. That adds up to 44 total countries, or 50 if you include six other countries that Standley said received some early support specifically related to the Ebola outbreak.",,,,"'(Barack Obama) set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus, exactly.",refuted,false,<p>The spending bills that lawmakers ultimately passed provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump's budget requests asked for.</p>,politifact

We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.","Sen. Loretta Weinberg isn't shy about attacking Gov. Chris Christie, but when it comes to him not making pension payments, she could show a little patience. The Bergen County Democrat took aim in a recent column on bluejersey.com at the Republican governor's record of making no payments to the state's pension funds. 'He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke,' Weinberg wrote in a Nov. 21 column on the left-leaning blog. PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Weinberg's claim is technically correct, but still somewhat misleading. The Christie administration has not yet made a pension contribution, but a payment of nearly $500 million is scheduled to be made before the current fiscal year ends in June 2012. That amount represents a fraction of the nearly $3.4 billion needed to fully fund the state's fiscal year contribution. Even though one is scheduled, Weinberg argued in a phone interview that Christie has not made any pension payments. 'Whether he'll do it in the future, we'll see,' said Weinberg, before referring to her statement. 'I don't think it's misleading....It's a statement of fact.' Let's review Christie's track record with the pension system. In the fiscal year 2011 budget -- Christie's first spending plan -- the governor did not make any pension contributions, even though a payment of about $3 billion was required to fully fund the state's share in that fiscal year. But in March 2010, Christie signed a law passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full contribution. That policy kicks off with fiscal year 2012, which began in July of this year. The state's payment is slated to increase by at least an additional one-seventh in each succeeding fiscal year until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and afterwards. Christie approved a fiscal year 2012 budget that includes that one-seventh payment for a combined contribution of about $484 million to six pension funds. The full contribution would be nearly $3.4 billion. In fact, Weinberg also agreed to make a pension payment by way of voting for the fiscal year 2012 budget. The actual payment will be made at some point during the next seven months in order to use cash on hand, according to Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman. Making the pension payment now would likely mean borrowing money, Pratt said. Historically, pension payments are made in the final few weeks of a fiscal year, Pratt told us. Toward the end of a fiscal year, more tax revenue is coming in and most other expenses have been paid, he said. 'It's a fiscally prudent thing to do,' Pratt said. 'It's always better to pay in cash.' State officials also approved pension and health benefit reform last summer, requiring greater employee contributions toward the benefits.

That's because when earmarks are stricken by congressional vote, the money is typically reallocated to other spending, rather than saved outright. But he added that it would be possible to devise a budgeting process in which spending goes down if an earmark is eliminated. A Lugar spokesman, Mark Helmke, said that as long as the administration does not use money dedicated to earmarks for debt reduction, the moratorium would not reduce spending. 'The only way that spending is reduced is to cut program spending, and Sen. Lugar is prepared to do that,' Helmke said. Indirectly, earmarks may have an I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine effect that pushes spending upward. Under the status quo, however, our experts agreed that Lugar is largely correct -- ending earmarks won't directly reduce spending, only re-direct it. There are other plausible reasons to advocate for an earmark ban, such as ending unseemly horse-trading with taxpayer dollars. But without a thorough overhaul of the budgeting process, saving money directly isn't one of them. We rate Lugar's statement Mostly True.","One of the congressional Republicans' first actions after the 2010 election was to take a stand on curbing earmarks -- the targeted congressional spending provisions that have been criticized by politicians ranging from President Barack Obama to most members of the tea party movement. An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good. On Nov. 16, 2010, after pressure from newly elected, tea party-backed Republican candidates as well as incumbents on the right flank of the GOP, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blessed an earmark moratorium, even though McConnell had been an active earmarker for much of his congressional career. 'Make no mistake, I know the good that has come from the projects I have helped support throughout my state,' McConnell said. 'I don't apologize for them. But there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused Americans to view it as a symbol of the waste and the out-of-control spending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight. And unless people like me show the American people that we're willing to follow through on small or even symbolic things, we risk losing them on our broader efforts to cut spending and rein in government.' Two days after McConnell's announcement, the new House Republican majority voted to enact a ban on earmarks in the 112th Congress as well. Yet as popular as banning earmarks appears to be, a few lawmakers have urged caution. Some have argued that giving up Congress' right to direct where money goes effectively cedes those powers to the executive branch, centralizing more power than ever in the presidential administration. Some have argued that, in the context of the entire federal budget, the dollar amounts are trivial -- roughly $15 billion out of a $1.4 trillion deficit in 2009. Critics say that focusing on earmarks is a symbolic action that obscures the harder choices that will be needed to reduce the federal deficit and cut into the national debt. One lawmaker, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., made a stark point: Cutting earmarks won't actually save money. 'I oppose the Senate Republican Conference voluntary moratorium on so-called 'earmarks,' ' Lugar said in a prepared statement. 'At a moment in which over-spending by the federal government perpetuates annual deficits of over $1 trillion a year, the Congress is being asked to debate a congressional earmark spending resolution which will save no money, even while giving the impression that the Congress is attempting to meet the public demand to reduce spending. Instead of surrendering constitutional authority to Washington bureaucrats and the Obama Administration, Congress should focus on reducing spending on both entitlement and discretionary spending programs. Providing the Obama Administration with greater authority to direct spending does not accomplish this goal, and eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending.' It's the last part -- the notion that 'eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending' -- that caught our eye. We wondered whether it's accurate. Since earmarks are simply provisions of larger spending bills that direct where lawmakers want the money to go, earmarks, strictly speaking, do not increase the cost of a spending bill -- they only tell where portions of that spending should go. If Congress doesn't specify where the money should be spent, it would be up to executive branch officials to make the decision instead. Joshua Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that favors balanced budgets and reducing the national debt, calls Lugar's statement 'accurate.' 'The moratoriums would not save any money,' Gordon said. 'They just change who is allowed to direct where money is spent.' Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, agrees that Lugar is right, though he adds that the existence of earmarks increases the upward pressure on federal spending indirectly, since lawmakers 'know they need to support the relevant powers on the spending committees in order to have their earmarks approved.' Mitchell calls earmarks a 'gateway drug' that 'seduces members into treating the federal budget as a good thing that can be milked for home-state/district projects.' Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group critical of earmarks, said Lugar is correct that, under the current budgeting process, eliminating earmarks won't save money. That's because when earmarks are stricken by congressional vote, the money is typically reallocated to other spending, rather than saved outright. But he added that it would be possible to devise a budgeting process in which spending goes down if an earmark is eliminated. A Lugar spokesman, Mark Helmke, said that as long as the administration does not use money dedicated to earmarks for debt reduction, the moratorium would not reduce spending. 'The only way that spending is reduced is to cut program spending, and Sen. Lugar is prepared to do that,' Helmke said. Indirectly, earmarks may have an I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine effect that pushes spending upward. Under the status quo, however, our experts agreed that Lugar is largely correct -- ending earmarks won't directly reduce spending, only re-direct it. There are other plausible reasons to advocate for an earmark ban, such as ending unseemly horse-trading with taxpayer dollars. But without a thorough overhaul of the budgeting process, saving money directly isn't one of them.

The police-custody death of a Black man, George Floyd, in May led to a national reckoning around race, including at the University of Florida, which decided to ban the 'Gator Bait,' a traditional cheer used at sporting events, for its association with racist imagery. In June 2020, the university President Kent Fuchs announced a list of steps the university was taking to combat racism. One of these included 'moving forward with symbolism and behavior consistent with our values.'

The cheer involves fans shouting 'Gator Bait' and using their arms to mimic an alligator's mouth chomping when the band plays a school tune associated with the cheer. According to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University, Black children in the South were in fact sometimes used to bait alligators in the late 1800s and early 1900s, though the historicity of that claim is in question. Snopes itself conducted a 2017 investigation into the alleged practice and found a plethora of examples of images and songs in popular culture illustrating this racist trope. Conversations with historians and archival research offered us little evidence that such incidents actually took place, but we also couldn't actually prove that this cruel practice never took place. Like other demeaning stereotypes about Black people, the notion that dark-skinned children were a favorite food of alligators and crocodiles was commonplace in the antebellum United States.

Before we address this question, we should note that the USPS is a unique government organization. It's a part of the executive branch, but unlike a typical federal employer, it can go belly up. And unlike with a typical business, Congress can pass laws that directly dictate how the Postal Service spends billions of dollars. One of these is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. It requires the Postal Service to do what's called 'prefund' 100 percent of the health benefits for its future retirees. The cost: About $5 billion a year until 2017. This is how it works. Each year, the federal government estimates how much Postal Service employees earned in pension and health retirement benefits and calculates what the USPS needs to save to pay these bills in the future. By law, the USPS has to store that money in a trust fund. The federal Office of Personnel Management, which oversees pensions for federal workers, acknowledged in a Feb. 28 study that among federal employers, the retiree health benefit funding rule is unique to the post office. They also said it's essential. The USPS could go out of business, sticking the federal government with a bill it cannot pay. This could force the entire federal retiree health program to go broke, the OPM report argued. Now, let's look at Bishop's claim. Federal employers: Under the current retirement system, all federal employers, including the Postal Service, must prefund their pension benefits. And as we explained earlier, the USPS does have unique health benefit funding rules. It's therefore accurate that under the current retirement system, no federal employer aside from the Postal Service must prefund 100 percent of both its retiree health and pension benefits. State and local governments: No federal or state rules require state or local governments to fully fund pension or health benefits, said Keith Brainard, director of research for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. None of the experts we interviewed had heard of cities, towns or counties with health prefunding requirements. Private industry: By federal law, private companies must fund their pensions fully, and catch up over time if they fall behind. They don't have to prefund retiree health benefits. This means there's no reason to go postal over the claim by Bishop and others that 'no other public or private business in America' except for the USPS must fund 100 percent of employee pension and retirement health costs in advance. By and large, this statement fits the evidence. We do take some issue with the claim's broader point, which is that the retirement funding requirement unfairly singles out the post office.

On paper, the numbers support that comparison. Previous Republican administrations applied the abortion funding policy to family planning programs, which amount today to about $600 million. Trump included all global health spending, which is nearly $10 billion. There is no question Trump's approach is broader and that millions more people could be affected. The White House has not clarified how it will interpret the policy. Its reach could be much narrower than the full scope of global programs, but Shaheen included the caveat that certain dollars were 'at risk,' not that they definitely would be affected. It's also true that organizations facing funding cuts could drop activities related to abortion and the funds would continue to flow. Given what we know so far, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d02c95c8-3f03-49cc-992e-bff8ad2d0a45","Among the flurry of policies President Donald Trump put in force in his first week was to reimpose a ban on taxpayer dollars going to overseas groups that have anything to do with abortion. The so-called Mexico City policy was born under President Ronald Reagan and since then, with partisan regularity, Republican presidents invoke it and Democratic ones reject it. On the Senate floor, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., warned that Trump's version was even more extreme than those of his GOP predecessors. 'Previously, under President Reagan and the Bush administrations, this policy applied only to family planning funding,' Shaheen said. 'But under President Trump's order, it applies to every program that falls under global health assistance. This means that it puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families.' We compared the policies of all four Republican presidents and found that on paper, Shaheen's number is largely correct, but there's uncertainty surrounding Trump's policy. The first Mexico City policy Reagan administration officials announced a new U.S. family planning policy at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City. It required all nongovernmental organizations, foreign and domestic, receiving aid from the United States to agree that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other countries. This applied to U.S. family planning programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development. President George H. W. Bush left the Reagan policy in place. President Bill Clinton rescinded it, and President George W. Bush brought it back with the focus still on family planning through the U.S. Agency for International Development. But in 2003, Bush expanded the reach of the policy, instructing the secretary of state to apply it to 'all assistance for voluntary population planning.' Even as he did that, Bush excluded a number of groups and programs. 'Such organizations do not include multilateral organizations that are associations of governments,' Bush wrote. 'This policy shall not apply to foreign assistance furnished pursuant to the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.' With those words, Bush exempted some of the largest and highest profile global health programs. Those programs, experts told us, dwarfed any other programs at the State Department that Bush's order might have affected. Trump's presidential memorandum to reinstate the Mexico City policy is broader. In addition to the head of USAID, it is addressed to the departments of State and Health and Human Services. 'I direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent allowable by law, to implement a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated Memorandum to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.' The operative phrase is 'global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.' Trump's order provides no exceptions. It's unclear exactly how the Trump administration will interpret those words. We asked the White House press office for details and did not hear back. The experts we reached told us they too were in the dark. Comparing family planning and global health programs The pipeline of family planning and global health programs is more complicated than you might expect. Governments agencies often contract with nonprofits which in turn subcontract out to smaller organizations in countries around the world. Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said this makes it difficult to know the real impact of the order. 'Not all of the organizations that directly or indirectly receive U.S. government global health support carry out the activities prohibited by the policy, but figuring that out will take some time,' Kates told us. However, Kates said that in theory, Trump's policy puts a lot more funding on the line. 'Whereas family planning assistance represents about $600 million per year, global health funding overall is close to $10 billion,' Kates said. Data gathered by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation allows us to tease out exactly which programs Bush exempted from the Mexico City policy, but that Trump has included (see this IHME data graphic). Remember, Bush kept money for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis off the table, as well as U.S. support for programs involving multiple nations, the big ones being the Global Fund and United Nations programs. Add all of those up and you get $9.7 billion. That's about 15 times as much money as the United States spends on family planning, which was the core program affected across all three previous Republican administrations. Shaheen said millions of women and families might be affected. In spending, the single largest global health program is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. According to the latest report to Congress, PEPFAR treated 9.5 million people in 2015, at a cost of about $6.8 billion. Trump, along with his Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, has voiced support for PEPFAR. But in theory, since many HIV/AIDS programs include a family planning component, the programs that touch those people might be affected by Trump's Mexico City policy. If the policy extends to malaria programs, the numbers climb dramatically. In 2015, American dollars protected over 16 million people with indoor spraying and many more through the distribution of nearly 30 million bed nets.",,,,Says Donald Trump's abortion rule 'puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families ... than previous similar policies by Republican presidents.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact
22474,11438,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sayoc-van-false-flag/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 26 October 2018, a 56-year-old Florida resident named Cesar Sayoc was arrested on suspicion of having mailed a series of explosive devices to Democratic officials and other critics of President Trump over the previous several days. A post-arrest look into Sayoc's background quickly revealed that he appeared to be an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, having attended at least two Trump rallies in Florida and driving a van whose windows were festooned with pro-Trump stickers: Even before Sayoc's arrest, Trump supporters and assorted conspiracy buffs had already been pushing a theory that the mail bombs 'were not actually part of a plot to harm Democrats, but were a 'false flag' operation concocted by leftists in order to paint conservatives as violent radicals ahead of the [midterm] elections': A range of high-profile conservatives have embraced a conspiracy theory that mail bombs sent to liberal public figures are a 'false flag' attack by leftwingers. Many have also claimed that the attacks are intended to elicit sympathy for Democrats ahead of the looming midterm elections. Authorities are yet to identify a suspect or motive in the bombings, which have seen 12 pipe bombs sent to a range of figures from former president Barack Obama to Bill and Hillary Clinton to financier George Soros and even to the out-spoken actor Robert De Niro. All the suspects have one thing in common: they have been targets of Donald Trump's ire. Nevertheless, without evidence, a number of ostensibly mainstream conservatives joined more overtly conspiracist outlets in either expressing skepticism that conservatives would damage their own cause, or making outright accusations that the left are orchestrating the bombing campaign in order to sabotage Republicans. Not dissuaded by the evidence when a suspect was finally taken into custody, the conspiracy theorists quickly disclaimed evidence such as Sayoc's van, maintaining that it was too obviously 'staged': The 'staged van' claim had a fatal flaw to it, though: south Florida residents had been spotting and photographing Sayoc's unusual van with its collection of pro-Trump stickers for up to a year before his arrest. The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, for example, reported on the many locals who had observed Sayoc and his prominent vehicle around town long before the wave of mail bombings and his subsequent arrest: From Aventura to Hollywood to Davie and farther, people have gawked and photographed the oddball vehicle for some time. 'I saw this van dozens of times. It always struck me, always unsettled me. It appeared that somebody at times was in the van, though it was hard to tell because of the windows,' said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who co-produced 2006's 'Cocaine Cowboys.' 'This is also Miami and you don't know - this guy's an enthusiastic Trump supporter, that's one thing, but the number of stickers he had on his car combined with some of the more threatening stickers seemed to indicate this might be a person with a problem you don't want to confront directly, especially in Miami, where you don't know if anybody's armed.' Cypkin encountered the van regularly when he lived near the Shoppes at the Waterways in Aventura, where it was regularly parked. Cypkin believed someone could be living in the van, and finally, on the morning of New Year's Eve 2017, he snapped a few quick pictures so he could get a better look at some of the stickers later. 'I had seen it there at least a year,' Cypkin said. 'I did see someone standing at the back one time, with one of the back doors open. I didn't make eye contact.' In Davie, people frequently saw the van outside Whole Foods, and Geo Rodriguez, a former South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter, came across it in front of Papa John's pizza in Hollywood. On April 6, he stepped outside a 7-11 and saw the van, parked on the swale next to Hollywood Boulevard, in front of the Papa John's. Several readers said they have seen the van delivering pizza. I've seen him off and on. You can tell he's from around here,' Rodriguez said. 'I see him at the Publix here in Hollywood all the time. He's kind of like a fixture.' In fact, as exemplified by the following Vice article excerpt, some commenters began debating after Sayoc's arrest whether his van shouldn't have been called to the attention of law enforcement authorities well before he allegedly began sending explosive devices through the mail: After media outlets broadcast images of Sayoc's ride being impounded by FBI agents, Miami locals began posting photos of the van taken as far back as last winter ... But even as the inflammatory rhetoric on the windows of Sayoc's van attracted the curiosity of nervous onlookers, conversations with federal law enforcement and free speech experts suggested the decals and the messaging alone likely did not represent actionable criminal conduct. In other words, despite hate crimes being on the rise and the majority of extremist violence being carried out by right-wing white supremacists, a violence-adorned MAGA van is almost certainly just that: a vehicle some Americans might find objectionable. 'You can't do anything about the stickers and the decals,' Chris Quick, a former FBI joint terrorism task force agent, told me. 'That is free speech. It doesn't matter if it was one or 20 stickers.' None of this is likely to dissuade the faithful, however, as conspiracy theorists tend to pick and choose their evidence while ignoring substantive proof that contradicts their claims. In this case, any conspiracy adherent would have to believe the far-fetched notion that Sayoc was engaged to attend Republican political rallies and drive (and possibly live in) in a van prominently marked with political stickers for a year or more in order to set up a 'false flag' plot that wouldn't play out until long afterwards.","Was Cesar Sayoc's Van 'Staged' as Part of a 'False Flag' Operation?

The report said a local mortician was being held for psychiatric evaluation in connection with charges of organ trafficking: Police made an astonishing discovery this morning while executing a search warrant at the residence of a Bloomington mortician: 218 embalmed human penises. Authorites [sic] suspected 54-year old Paul Houston, an employee of the McLean County Coroner's Office, of being implicated in an organ trafficking network. Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts, dozens of police raided his residence this Monday morning, hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes. What they found on the site was a lot more disturbing than what they expected, as the Police spokesman Andy Ramirez described the scene in an interview with WMBD. 'There were shelves everywhere, filled with hundreds of glass jars. Each of them contained a penis floating in formalin.' The article included an image that appeared to be a screen capture of a version of the story broadcast on the Fox News Channel: Several aspects of the story raised doubts about its legitimacy, however. For starters, the article referenced an interview with a police spokesman named Andy Ramirez which supposedly aired on WMBD, a Bloomington television station. We were unable to find any record of a Bloomington police spokesperson by that name, nor evidence that WMBD had interviewed anyone by that name in connection with any recent police investigations. We were also unable to find the named suspect, Paul Houston, listed as a staff member on the web page of the McLean County Coroner's Office. In point of fact, in a statement to Cities 92.9 (a Bloomington radio station), County Coroner Kathy Donovan-Davis said that no person by that name had worked there in the entire history of the McLean County Coroner's Office. When asked if organ harvesting is going on in Bloomington or McLean County, Donovan-Davis replied, 'No, there is not.' The first anyone in her office heard of the alleged incident was when the phones 'blew up' with calls from upset citizens, she said: 'People actually believed the fake news, which is really sad.' One clue that ought to have alerted readers to the hoax was the URL of the spoof website: foxnews-us.com (the legitimate URL of Fox News Channel's website is www.foxnews.com). Also, the story may have had a familiar ring to some of our readers. A search of our fact-check archive turned up a similar fabricated news item from 2017: 'FBI Seizes Over 3,000 Penises During Raid at Morgue Employee's Home.'

So, teachers were slightly down as a share of school district workforces and administrators were up. But how 'extraordinary' (in Perry's words) was that increase? Frazier said the figures fueling Perry's statement trace to a December recommendation by State Comptroller Susan Combs that the state 'study patterns in school district administrative staffing.' From 1998-99 to 2008-09, Combs says, the ratio of Texas school teachers to administrators declined from nearly 14-to-1 to 13-to-1--meaning 1,571 administrative positions would have to be cut to achieve the previous ratio. Administrators are defined in the recommendation as superintendents at all levels (assistant, associate and deputy), chief administrative officers, chief executive officers and/or presidents, tax assessors and/or collectors, athletic directors, business managers, directors of personnel and/or human resources, instructional officers, principals, assistant principals, registrars and teacher supervisers. Tom Currah, an assistant director at the comptroller's office, told us in an interview that Combs focused on positions the education agency defines as administrative--not counting, for instance, counselors, librarians, janitors and similar support and auxiliary staff. 'We were looking at management types,' Currah said. Next, we used the TEA's counts to take a crack at school districts' staff changes over the decade. Some perspective: Student enrollment increased from more than 3.9 milllion in 1998-99 to more than 4.8 million in 2009-10, up 22 percent. For 2009-10, the state counted 333,090 teachers, up 28 percent from 1998-99, and 25,525 administrative posts, up 48 percent. Districts' employees over all totaled 661,286, an increase of 31 percent. Staffing was down from 1998-99 in only one of nine administrative categories, tax assessor-collectors. Among other categories, the biggest percentage increases resided in district instructional program directors or executive directors (up 55 percent); assistant principals (up 53 percent); and directors of personnel/human resources (up 51 percent). The biggest increase in raw numbers, from 3,167 to 9,129, was for assistant principals. We noticed that another school employee category, support staff, increased by a larger margin than administrative staff--by 60 percent to 59,571 positions as of 2009-10. Two other categories, paraprofessionals and auxiliary staff, increased less than 30 percent each. Among support staff positions, 'other campus professional personnel' increased nearly 300 percent, totaling 5,635 in 2009-10, and other non-instructional district personnel nearly doubled to 13,568. TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us examples of other campus professionals, who serve on one or more campuses, include community liaisons, informational technology staff and instructional officers. Examples of non-instructional personnel include administrative department heads, associates or assistants and professional-level staff in areas including food service, research/evaluation, transportation, purchasing and security. Next, we looked at the overall change in all non-classroom employees, who increased 33 percent to 328,194 from 1998-99 to 2009-10. One way of summing this up is to say the districts' overall hiring rate of non-classroom workers ran 18 percent ahead of the hiring rate for teachers. How come? Lynn Moak, a former TEA administrator and Austin lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, suggested in an interview that some of the faster-paced increase in support staff traces to positions funded by federal, not state, aid. Broadly, he said, the increase reflects districts hiring people to guide teachers and students toward fulfilling toughened accountability standards. 'You didn't do that by adding more teachers' necessarily, Moak said. 'You did that by making the teachers we had better.' A March 4 online post by his firm, Moak, Casey & Associates, says that most of these non-teaching, non-administrative staffers 'are providing services to students' and 'are not easily expendable, particularly if current service levels are to be maintained and compliance with federal and state requirements is to be met.' 'If you're trying to maintain student performance while you're trying to go through these financially tight times, you're going to see a lot of different patterns depending on how the district is organized and how the district is doing,' Moak said. 'If the district is needing a lot of help from these other (non-classroom) staff, the district may choose to keep these other staff rather than keep teachers.' Upshot: Over the decade, the increase in non-classroom employees -- especially in support and administrative staff -- outpaced growth in student enrollment and teachers. But whether this addition of non-classroom staff qualifies as 'extraordinary' is open to debate. We rate Perry's statement Mostly True.","Hinting that Texas school districts should adjust budgets without laying off loads of teachers, Gov. RIck Perry told Capitol reporters March 9 that non-classroom school employees are burgeoning. 'Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to (Texas public) school rolls,' Perry said. 'So are the administrators and the school boards going to make a decision to reduce those, or are they going to make a decision to reduce the number of teachers in the classroom? I certainly know where I would point.' Responding to a request for more information that day, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an e-mail that from 1998-99 to 2008-09, the number of Texas public school teachers rose 27.1 percent from 256,276 to 325,809 while the number of administrators increased 35.6 percent from 18,531 to 25,130. Diving in, we broadened the back-up comparison bandied by Perry's office to encompass a full decade. In 1998-99, according to TEA, teachers comprised 51 percent of the state's 506,604 full-time employees and administrative staff made up 3.4 percent. Other non-classroom workers, including support and auxiliary staff, accounted for the rest. In 2009-10, teachers amounted to 50 percent and administrative staff accounted for nearly 4 percent of the state's 661,286 full-tiime school district posts.

You've probably seen the stories. The Transportation Security Administration's new full-body scanners, which are in use at 68 airports nationwide, transfer a potentially harmful amount of radiation and produce what amounts to a naked image, critics say. And the alternative to the scan, an embarrassing pat down, may be even worse. Pilots' unions oppose the measures, as do an increasing number of passengers -- who feel the federal government has taken things too far. PolitiFact can't weigh in on that. But we can explore the safety concerns about the full-body scan. Particularly, we found worth analyzing the defense mounted by John Pistole, head of the TSA. During a Nov. 16, 2010, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Pistole said the 'radiation coming from those machines are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet.' The TSA, on its website, says the radiation emitted from the body scan is equivalent to just two minutes of a plane flight. Are those claims credible? Yes. Though there is some disagreement. Let us explain. In preparing to deploy the scanners to airports across the country, the TSA studied the amount of radiation a person would be exposed to per scan to determine if the machines were safe. Scientists at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory found that the effective dose per screening was 1.58 microrems of radiation, while a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said an adult would be exposed to 2.4 microrems of radiation per scan. We understand those figures mean nothing to most people. So let's put it into perspective. A single chest X-ray exposes a person to between 8,000 and 10,000 microrems (or 8 to 10 millirems), according to experts at Princeton University and the Department of Energy. A pack-a-day smoker exposes himself to 15,000 to 20,000 microrems of radiation a year (tobacco leaves used in making cigarettes contain radioactive lead and polonium). Put simply, it would take at least 3,300 body scans to reach the equivalent of one chest X-ray. What's also important to note -- and a bit scary -- is that you're being exposed to radiation right now. Radiation is naturally occurring in our environment no matter where you are. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that each year, the average adult is exposed to 300 millirems of naturally occurring radiation (300,000 microrems) and 60 millirems (60,000 microrems) of man-made radiation. Pistole, in his claim, is talking about naturally occurring cosmic radiation you're exposed to during airplane travel. The amount of cosmic radiation a person is exposed to varies based on a number of factors, but to oversimplify, a key component is how high you are above sea level. People living in Denver, which is 1 mile above sea level, are exposed to more cosmic radiation than someone living in Florida. And people flying 30,000 feet in the air are exposed to more radiation than people on the ground. The amount of radiation varies depending upon the specific flight plan, but the Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission all say that a person on a six- to eight-hour flight will be exposed to somewhere around 2,000 to 5,000 microrems of radiation. For our analysis, however, we are relying on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates the radiation exposure per hour based on the altitude of the flight. According to NOAA, a person flying at 30,000 feet will be exposed to between 285 and 406 microrems of radiation an hour, or between 4.75 and 6.77 microrems per minute of flight. All the numbers and science back up Pistole's claim -- as little as three minutes of air travel produces the equivalent amount of radiation as one TSA body scan. By most estimates, Pistole's claim actually is conservative. However, all scientists aren't sold on the comparison. Nor are they sold on the safety of the scanners. We think it's important for you hear their side, too. Four faculty members at the University of California, San Francisco, authored a letter in April expressing their concerns about the body scanning devices. Primarily, the professors worried that the radiation was being concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue, and that it was not being dispersed throughout the entire body. That concentration of radiation to the skin could be 'dangerously high,' wrote the faculty members -- John Sedat, Marc Shuman, Robert Stroud and David Agard, who said a comparison to cosmic radiation spread over the entire body is misleading. The FDA, in a detailed response, said the concerns were unfounded, and health risks associated with the full body scanners were 'minuscule.' To be clear, this fact check isn't declaring TSA's new full-body scanners safe. We're simply looking at the comparative exposure to radiation as suggested by Pistole, who said that the radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners 'are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet.' It may sound strange, but it's right. We rate this statement True.

By most estimates, Pistole's claim actually is conservative. However, all scientists aren't sold on the comparison. Nor are they sold on the safety of the scanners. We think it's important for you hear their side, too. Four faculty members at the University of California, San Francisco, authored a letter in April expressing their concerns about the body scanning devices. Primarily, the professors worried that the radiation was being concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue, and that it was not being dispersed throughout the entire body. That concentration of radiation to the skin could be 'dangerously high,' wrote the faculty members -- John Sedat, Marc Shuman, Robert Stroud and David Agard, who said a comparison to cosmic radiation spread over the entire body is misleading. The FDA, in a detailed response, said the concerns were unfounded, and health risks associated with the full body scanners were 'minuscule.' To be clear, this fact check isn't declaring TSA's new full-body scanners safe. We're simply looking at the comparative exposure to radiation as suggested by Pistole, who said that the radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners 'are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet.' It may sound strange, but it's right. We rate this statement True.",,,,"The radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners is 'equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet.",supported,true,,politifact

6725,6180,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-prisons-universities/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In early May 2021, celebrity influencer Kim Kardashian posted a striking photograph to her Instagram story. The picture was a display of 22 orange prison jumpsuits and a single graduation cap and gown affixed to a white wall, along with the words, 'Since 1980 California built 22 prisons' and one university. The numbers in the image are not totally accurate because they are out of date by several years, but the underlying message is true: Since 1980, California has opened far more state prisons than public universities. California has two public university systems - the California State University (CSU) system and the University of California (UC) system. There are 23 institutions that make up the CSU system. Of those, two were built after 1980: CSU Channel Islands, which opened in 2002, and CSU San Marcos, which opened in 1989. The UC system has 10 campuses. Only one of those, UC Merced, opened after 1980. That campus opened in 2005. Meanwhile, California operates 35 adult state prisons. And it opened at least 23 of them after 1980. (The state is in the process of closing some prisons, however.) That number doesn't even account for other types of correctional facilities run by the state, including fire camps and juvenile detention. The image in Kardashian's post is a photograph taken of a social justice-themed art exhibit in May 2015, which took place in Los Angeles. The source of the claim about the number of prisons built versus the number of universities appears to be a 2014 article posted by The California Endowment, a California nonprofit organization that promotes investment in the health of communities over incarceration. The 2014 article discussed what was then a new campaign called Do the Math, focused on revealing how much the state spends on incarcerating its residents as opposed to educating them, with the aim to change that dynamic. The article noted that because of harsh automatic sentencing laws like the 'three strikes' law, California overspends on incarceration while underinvesting in education. 'Three strikes' is a mandatory minimum sentencing law in California that requires harsher prison terms than a crime in and of itself calls for, if a defendant has prior convictions. Our campaign will first focus on the issue of prison spending. Today we incarcerate about 30,000 people - one out of every six people in state prison - for offenses like shoplifting and possessing small amounts of drugs. We used to hold people accountable for these crimes without sending them to prison, but harsh and automatic sentencing laws like Three Strikes placed many more people behind bars. The result? California has built 22 prisons and just one university since the 1980s. And we spend $10 billion a year on our prison system. Just think of what else we could do with the $62,300 a year that it costs us to keep someone in state prison.

We rate Crowley's claim True.","Relations between Russia and the United States have been decidedly frosty recently, and the international spirit of the Olympics doesn't seem to have delivered much of a thaw. Or at least, that is one way to read the roster of the official delegation to the games in Sochi. Former Homeland Security director Janet Napolitano leads the group named by the White House. CNN's Candy Crowley reminded Napolitano of how administrations have handled this before. 'I'm sure it's been noted to you, that it's been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics,' Crowley said on CNN's State of the Union. 'Can you tell me as a practitioner of both policy and politics why Sochi is different for the U.S.?' Napolitano denied that any snub of Russian President Vladimir Putin was intended. Obama, she said, had sent a group that 'represented the broad values of the United States.' The Obama administration has made it clear that acceptance of gays and lesbians ranks prominently among those values. When the White House announced the delegation list, a spokesperson said it 'represented the diversity that is the United States.' The list included the gay tennis star, Billie Jean King. Russia's anti-gay bias has become a sticking point between the two nations. The president himself said his schedule doesn't allow him to attend. The meaning behind the make-up of the delegation is a matter for diplomats and students of international relations. In this fact-check, we will look at whether the tradition that Crowley suggested actually has been in place since 2000. As this table shows, the record speaks for itself. While it's uncommon for an American president to attend, the White House has reliably extended the personal touch. Crowley's statement includes the important catch-all category of family member to make her claim accurate. As far back as 1998, the then-wife of Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore, represented the White House at the Winter games in Nagano, Japan. For the 2000 Summer games in Sydney, Australia, President Bill Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, took time off from college to watch the competition. In 2004, it was the president's father and mother, former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, who made the family connection in Athens, Greece. George W. Bush stands out for having personally attended twice. The first time, the games took place on American soil in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the leader of the host country pretty much always attends. But Bush also made the trip to Beijing in 2008 where he memorably bumped a volleyball to a bikini clad member of the U.S. beach volleyball team.",,,,'It's been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics.,supported,true,,politifact

What is your ethnic background composed of? Sites like Ancestry.com and 23andme have always been some go to sources in answering all of your toughest questions. But how accurate are they? In a recent interview with Cracked, one of the major ancestry testing companies, (which specific company is unknown) spilled the beans on what really happens when you purchase an ancestry kit. While I can't say I'm surprised, you may be shocked to learn that these ancestry sites aren't always as accurate as they claim to be. Beyond this, they've also admitted to tampering with the result to 'screw with racists'. It cited a 4 December 2017 Cracked.com piece, that relied on a single anonymous source for its most egregious claims, and ignored information from the Cracked piece that didn't line up with its claims. According to Squawker, 'DNA testing companies' admitted to the practice-plural-but Cracked.com only spoke with one purported employee. To boot, the claims made by the anonymous source were misrepresented. The source first discussed the unnamed company's 'tweak[ing]' of results on rare occasions, typically to make up for mathematical shortfalls or in cases where a customer might be deeply disappointed by the absence of a particular heritage, per Cracked: [Genetic questions] can be answered by sending a vial of your spit off to a company like Ancestry.com, 23andMe, or Living DNA ... in theory. But the reality of those businesses is a lot less science, and a lot more hustle. We talked with Morgan, who works for one of the major ancestry testing companies. He had some interesting things to say ... They Might Tweak Results To Avoid Pissing People Off Morgan admitted to having changed people's results. 'We only did this on rare occasions, when we knew they weren't using it as means to harm someone.' A lot of this is done under the guise of having the tests line up with what the business already knows of the customer's expectations. It's easier to do that than to deal with an endless parade of clients who are intensely pissed off because they aren't as Dutch as they expected to be. 'If the results only added up to 99.5 percent, we'd say, 'Let's stick that 0.5 percent under Scandinavian.'['] After asserting that it was 'really easy' to sabotage one's own result, the purported worker went on to mention two instances where a white customer indicated a strong disinclination to demonstrate black ancestry, per Cracked. They Will Screw With Racists 'I only know of two times somebody wanted to be tested for being another ethnicity because they didn't like that ethnicity. Both times, [they were] white people not wanting to believe they had black ancestors.' The first of these made an offhand remark that, ''I'm hoping it will show people I'm not black.' And not as a joke. He was serious.' The second customer was even less subtle: 'He caught himself from saying the N-bomb. He said, 'I want to know if any of my family are ni- black.'' Morgan and his colleagues were caught between a rock and a really-want-to-mess-with-racists place. It would've been fun to throw a '10 percent West African' in there, but then they might have a pissed-off, dangerous person at their office, waving a gun. 'Since we couldn't do anything to the results (and we wanted to), what we did was add '< 1 percent' to each African category of ethnicity. That way we weren't lying, and they would both be wondering how much under a percentage point was. We always try to round to the nearest number because we sometimes hear about percentage points, but for them, we leave it open to whether it's a one or a zero.' Squawker used this detail from Cracked's reporting to make an unsupported claim about a specific incident wherein a white supremacist discovered he had 14 percent 'black' ancestry, inferring that it is potentially DNA test tampering. Neither of the cases discussed in the Cracked story involved anywhere near the 14 percent black ancestry result that was used as an example by Squawker, but rather less than one percent: ... Remember when white supremacist Craig Cobb found out that he was 14% black? Well as it turns out, there's a possibility that those numbers could have been fudged with. ... This is beyond shady and deceptive, people pay more than they can really afford sometimes, just to find out the truth about their heritage. What about this is acceptable? How does this turn a racist into a 'non racist'? It doesn't. There's nothing but high levels of dishonesty in these companies. Unfortunately, this doesn't even fully cover the other things they do behind closed doors. DNA testing sites have been fielding questions from the public, and a 23andMe representative has responded on Facebook about the rumors: We contacted Ancestry.com and 23AndMe for further information. A representative for Ancestry.com responded: We can state, definitively, that we have not, nor ever would, alter a customer's DNA results. We believe in the power of science and our customers rely on us to provide as accurate a result as possible. We don't know where this anonymous individual worked, but we are confident they did not work here, as their claims in no way reflect the scientific rigor and focus on quality that we apply to everything we do at Ancestry. The 23AndMe representative explained: Any allegations that we manipulate results are 100% false. Customer results are based purely on science, which we've documented extensively: https://www.23andme.com/ancestry-composition-guide/. Further, the author cites outdated research (a paper that came out the year we launched our first product, nearly 10 years ago) and misrepresents a test done by sets of triplets and quadruplets, whose results when viewed at our highest confidence threshold were nearly identical. Although headlines suggested 'DNA testing companies' admitted they routinely tampered with customers' results and articles hinted that that fudging exceeded 10 percent, the claim was based on a humor web site's interview with an anonymous purported employee. Not only were the claims unvetted, but they are only alleged to have affected a sum total of two customers. The items referenced 23AndMe specifically, but the source material only claimed the person worked for 'one of the major ancestry testing companies.'

Most notably, this organism would require food. As a reference point, the amount of energy it takes for the closely related howler monkey to merely exist (let alone grow) in a tropical environment is 602 Calories per day. As this specific primate-like critter would be surviving in temperatures that regularly hit -100ºF, its metabolic costs would undoubtedly be higher.

State officials and environmentalists agree Schwarzenegger helped protect vast tracks of California's hills, forests and coastline. No other governor, they said, compares in this category. They also said Schwarzenegger benefitted from conservation efforts initiated before he took office, including plans for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy and state bond measures that helped fund much of the land protected under his watch.

We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE - The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","Arnold Schwarzenegger's achievements are many: Body builder. Movie star. Governator. Honorary Forest Ranger. Yes, he was named an Honorary Forest Ranger by the federal government. But was he California's environmental champion, its greenest governor in history, in terms of protecting the state's natural beauty through land conservation? That's what a top official with the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, Bonnie Reiss, claimed in a recent opinion column. 'When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California's history,' Reiss, the institute's global director, wrote in the Malibu Times on June 8, 2016. She continued: 'He established the Sierra Nevada Conservancy that oversees more than 25 million acres of land in Northern California, reached an agreement to preserve Hearst Ranch with its 13 miles of pristine coastline in Central California and brokered the Tejon Ranch Conservation Agreement that permanently preserved 90 percent of the 270,000-acre ranch in Southern California.' Schwarzenegger's publicist made the same claim about protecting 'more land' than any other California governor recently on Twitter. Reiss, who served as a senior advisor to then Gov. Schwarzenegger, also highlighted the recent completion of the National Park Service's Backbone Trail project near Malibu, to which Schwarzenegger donated 40 acres of his personal property. On the big screen, the Hollywood icon regularly saves the day. So we decided to fact-check whether he's saved 'more land' than any governor 'in California's history.' Our research Environmentalists and state officials said they are not aware of records that track land conservation by a governor. Reiss told us she knows of no official rankings. To back up her claim about Schwarzenegger, she pointed to articles by Wikipedia and an environmental nonprofit that describe the Sierra Nevada Conservancy as the largest of its kind in California and the nation. It operates across a huge swath: 25 million acres stretching from the Oregon border to Kern County. But that's the boundary inside which land can be protected. The total acreage conserved by the agency is much less -- about 58,000 acres over the past decade, according to a conservancy spokeswoman. That is still a large patchwork of protected land. But Reiss' emphasis on the 25 million acre boundary muddies the water. 'It's not like they created a new park,' said Bill Magavern, who was director of Sierra Club California at the same time Schwarzenegger was governor. 'They established a new government entity.' Schwarzenegger did not originate plans for the conservancy -- he signed a bill into law in 2004 creating it. The state agency administers grants to local governments and trusts seeking to preserve land. Also in response to our questions, Reiss pointed to the conservation of Hearst Ranch along the Central Coast and Tejon Ranch north of Los Angeles, two mammoth conservation deals, both completed during Schwarzenegger's tenure. Those protected 80,000 acres and 240,000 acres, respectively, according to websites for each. Environmentalists say Schwarzenegger deserves credit, not as the architect of the deals, but as a significant player in both. The Tejon Ranch Company describes its agreement as the largest private conservation deal in California history. Then California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks in May 2008 at Tejon Ranch. State officials we spoke with, including researchers at the California State Library, said they are not aware of any other governor whose administration protected larger collections of land. Conservation money While it's difficult to track governors by acreage protected, there's another way to measure their green works: Money raised for land conservation. During the early and mid-2000s, California voters approved nearly $20 billion for conservation through six bond measures. This was 'a huge influx of money,' dwarfing amounts raised in previous decades, said Bryan Cash, who serves as deputy assistant secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency under current Gov. Jerry Brown and also worked for the agency under Gov. Schwarzenegger. Four of the bond measures were approved under Gov. Gray Davis, but later implemented by Schwarzenegger. The voter-approved bond money led to the preservation of 1.5 million acres across California from 2000 to 2011, Cash said. 'The statement,' about Schwarzenegger protecting more land than any California governor, 'is probably true,' Cash added. Cash said money still flows to conservation under the Brown Administration, but significantly less than in the 2000s.

Illinois toll booth operators? The first group seems to make pretty good coin. But when doing work for the State of Wisconsin, private-practice lawyers who take public defender cases haven't gotten a raise since 1992. The fact the so-called 'private-bar rate' -- $40 an hour -- hasn't been raised in more than 18 years outraged Marla Stephens, head of the appellate division of the state public defender's office. Stephens, who lost in the February 2011 primary election for state Supreme Court, raised the issue at a candidates forum on Jan. 27, 2011, saying: 'The State of Wisconsin pays attorneys that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case. The State of Wisconsin pays plumbers that it hires and engineers that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour to do work for the state.' OK, we'll pause here for this acknowledgement: Stephens' claim was made weeks ago, before that little budget-repair bill from Gov. Scott Walker caught our attention. But her claim still stands and it provides some insight into how the state provides legal representation for poor adults who are facing jail or prison. First, a little background. The Legislature created the state public defender's office in 1978. Public defenders, who are state employees, represent the indigent in every county in Wisconsin. They mostly handle adult criminal cases, but they also work civil matters such as paternity cases. At the time, the Legislature created a two-tier pay system for private-practice attorneys who put themselves on a list to be assigned cases by the public defender. The hourly rates peaked in 1992 -- $50 for in-court work and $40 for out-of-court work. The current, single rate of $40 an hour has been in place since 1995. Despite the lack of raises, some 1,300 private-practice attorneys take public defender cases. In 2010, they handled 53,380 cases, two-thirds of them criminal, according to Deborah Smith, the assigned counsel division director for the public defender's office. So that's the lay of the land. Now let's examine what Stephens said. Her first claim was: The state pays private-practice attorneys 'much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case.' We asked Stephens' campaign manager, Jon Lipshutz, for evidence to support her two claims. On this point, he cited two Milwaukee Journal Sentinel articles. An August 2009 article said a Madison attorney was paid $175 an hour to represent the state in a lawsuit over the state's registry for same-sex couples. And a July 2010 article said the state paid another Madison attorney up to $665 an hour in a complex insurance case involving the receivership of Ambac Assurance Corp. Obviously, those attorneys were paid far more than $40 an hour -- but their cases were considerably different than the typical public defender case. To get a more comprehensive picture, we went to Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration. She said the lowest rate a state agency paid for an outside attorney over the past year was $95 an hour, for legal services to college students. The state Office of Lawyer Regulation, however, pays what is known as the Supreme Court rate of $70 an hour to attorneys it hires to prosecute lawyer misconduct cases. The Supreme Court rate is also used when judges appoint lawyers to cases for any reason. So, the lowest rate we could find that the state pays to lawyers for non-public defender cases is $70 an hour. That's $30, or 75 percent, more than what the state pays for public defender cases. Stephens' second claim was: The state pays plumbers and engineers 'much, much more than $40 an hour.' Lipshutz confirmed that Stephens was referring to plumbers and engineers hired on contract. He referred us to the state's VendorNet website but did not provide evidence of what the state pays contract plumbers and engineers. We again went to the Department of Administration. Vigue said engineers are paid $80 an hour -- twice the rate paid to private attorneys on public defender cases. Plumbers, meanwhile, are paid the prevailing wage, which varies by county and by the type of job. Vigue provided plumber rates for Milwaukee, Dane and Brown counties. The lowest rate for typical jobs, in Brown County, is $46.69 -- the basic hourly rate of $31.65, plus $15.04 per hour for fringe benefits. So, the state does have a rate it pays for certain plumbing jobs that is lower than the $40 public defender rate -- at least if benefits are not considered in the plumber rate. Of course, Stephens' larger point is that the amount paid for public defenders should be increased. Two attempts to force this to happen are pending. A March 2010 petition asks the Supreme Court to raise the court-appointed rate to $80 an hour and to index it to inflation. And the 2011-2013 state budget request by the public defender's office asks that the rate be raised to $70, at an estimated cost of $16.4 million per year. Let's return to the claim at hand. Attorney Marla Stephens said the state pays hourly rates to most lawyers, as well as to engineers and plumbers, that are 'much, much more' than the $40 it pays private-practice attorneys to handle public defender cases. That kind of characterization is subjective. But the rates paid to other attorneys and to engineers are considerably higher. The rate paid to some plumbers is lower, and only when benefits are not included. We rate Stephens' statement Mostly True.

By Tom Kertscher • November 15, 2021","Who deserves the least sympathy: lawyers, politicians ... Illinois toll booth operators? The first group seems to make pretty good coin. But when doing work for the State of Wisconsin, private-practice lawyers who take public defender cases haven't gotten a raise since 1992. The fact the so-called 'private-bar rate' -- $40 an hour -- hasn't been raised in more than 18 years outraged Marla Stephens, head of the appellate division of the state public defender's office. Stephens, who lost in the February 2011 primary election for state Supreme Court, raised the issue at a candidates forum on Jan. 27, 2011, saying: 'The State of Wisconsin pays attorneys that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case. The State of Wisconsin pays plumbers that it hires and engineers that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour to do work for the state.' OK, we'll pause here for this acknowledgement: Stephens' claim was made weeks ago, before that little budget-repair bill from Gov. Scott Walker caught our attention. But her claim still stands and it provides some insight into how the state provides legal representation for poor adults who are facing jail or prison. First, a little background. The Legislature created the state public defender's office in 1978. Public defenders, who are state employees, represent the indigent in every county in Wisconsin. They mostly handle adult criminal cases, but they also work civil matters such as paternity cases. At the time, the Legislature created a two-tier pay system for private-practice attorneys who put themselves on a list to be assigned cases by the public defender. The hourly rates peaked in 1992 -- $50 for in-court work and $40 for out-of-court work. The current, single rate of $40 an hour has been in place since 1995.

No such lawsuit has been heard by the Supreme Court. We rate it False.,"As new federal vaccine requirements go into effect, some social media posts are recirculating the false claim that the U.S. Supreme Court found the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe and 'canceled' universal vaccinations. 'Breaking news,' a Sept. 27 Instagram post reads, 'US Supreme Court has canceled universal vaccination in the United States.' The claim dates back to a May 23, 2021, article published on a website called 'Inspirer Radio.' It was wrong then, and it's still wrong now. The Supreme Court has not issued any ruling related to the COVID-19 vaccines or universal vaccinations, and there is currently no case on its docket involving challenges to vaccine mandates. There is also no 'universal vaccination' rule, although the federal government and many employers and institutions are tightening vaccination requirements. The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Instagram post that resurfaced the claim shows a video of someone scrolling through a lengthy chain message and reading it aloud. The message appears to be identical to the text of the Inspirer Radio article. It asserts that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group led by lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr., who is a nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and an anti-vaccine advocate, in a lawsuit against Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, federal infectious-disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci and 'Big Pharma,' because they failed 'to prove that all of their vaccines have been safe for the health of citizens' for the past '32 years.' The message makes several additional false claims about the mRNA vaccines, including that they have the ability to alter DNA. (They don't.) The post also erroneously identifies Kennedy as a U.S. senator and attributes a criticism of the COVID-19 vaccines to him. Kennedy told The Associated Press that the claim is false and the quote is fabricated. He added that while he's been involved in more than 30 vaccine safety lawsuits, the cases are at different stages of the judicial process and none have appeared before the Supreme Court.",,,,'Breaking news - US Supreme Court has canceled universal vaccination in the United States.,refuted,false,"<p>The United States Supreme Court has not issued any ruling related to the COVID-19 vaccines or universal vaccinations, and there is currently no case on its docket involving challenges to vaccine mandates. </p>",politifact
8981,14663,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-obama-administration-children-human-traffickers/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 17 June 2018, right-wing blogs published a flurry of stories reporting that the administration of former United States President Barack Obama had handed immigrant children over to human traffickers. The reports were posted in response to the public outcry over a policy enacted by Obama's successor, Donald Trump, whose administration in April 2018 announced a 'zero tolerance' immigration policy. Under this policy, all adults who are caught crossing the southern U.S. border between ports of entry are being charged with federal crimes and then separated from accompanying children. As the policy went into effect, news reports documenting scenes of distraught, traumatized children being torn from their parents by immigration authorities, and images migrant children being held in cages, created a backlash from both sides of the political spectrum against the Trump administration. In response to the growing fallout, the president's supporters wrote up stories criticizing his predecessor based on a 2015 criminal case and 2016 Senate report stemming from a Marion, Ohio human trafficking ring that used migrant children for forced labor on an egg farm. Right-leaning blogs like WesternJournal.com's Conservative Tribune for example confusingly reported the media was 'silent' about the case while aggregating their story from a New York Magazine report: The left-leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office... and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obama's administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago. 'The United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so-called 'caregivers,'' New York magazine reported in 2016, based on a Senate report. It's an obviously false statement that the 'left-leaning media stayed strangely silent' about the case, because a simple Google search reveals it has been thoroughly reported on by local and national outlets and is the subject of a PBS documentary film. As the text notes, Conservative Tribune's own story was based on such reporting. In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a ring of traffickers led by Aroldo Castillo-Serrano and accused them of smuggling children into the United States. They were also accused of lying to Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) by posing as relatives in order to gain custody of children in its care and use them for forced labor in Marion, a city north of Columbus. The federal indictment, filed in U.S. district court in Ohio accuses Castillo-Serrano and his conspirators of forcing the children to live in squalid trailers and work six or seven 12-hour days a week, using threats and physical violence as coercion. According to the Justice Department, Castillo-Serrano pleaded guilty in August 2015 to counts related to trafficking. He was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to the victims. The case spurred a Senate subcommittee investigation led by Rob Portman (R-Ohio) which concluded the processes used by ORR to screen sponsors 'are inadequate to protect the children in the agency's care.' At the time, HHS lacked a system to screen potential sponsors for signs of trafficking, like accumulating multiple unrelated children. It did not physically assess homes children were being placed in and did not do adequate background checks on adults residing in those homes. The report found that in 2014, 'HHS permitted a sponsor to block a child-welfare case worker from visiting with one of the victims, even after the case worker discovered the child was not living at the address on file with HHS.' As a result of the investigation, HHS and the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement to hammer out a joint plan that would address the issues raised in the report. As of 26 April 2018, that still had not happened according to Portman, who released a statement blasting the agencies for their failure to take action. He wrote: The agreement said the agencies would enter into a detailed 'Joint Concept of Operations' that would spell out what the agencies would do to fix the problems. They gave themselves a deadline of February 2017. That was over a year ago. It's now April 2018. We still don't have that Joint Concept of Operations - the JCO - and despite repeated questions from Sen. Carper and me, as well as our staffs, over the past year, we don't have any answers about why that is. In fact, in a recent meeting, a DHS official asked our investigators why we even cared about the JCO. The issue of HHS's lack of accountability for unaccompanied immigrant children came to a head in May 2018 when HHS acting assistant secretary of Administration for Children and Families Steven Wagner told a Senate oversight committee that the agency could not account for 1,475 children it had placed with sponsors from October to December 2017. The furor over that story accompanied outrage over the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policy, with critics raising concerns that the federal government was unnecessarily overwhelming an already-overburdened system with traumatized children. To make matters worse, an investigation published 19 June 2018 by McClatchy revealed that the figure was only a snapshot from a three-month period and the number of children who are unaccounted for by HHS is actually nearly 6,000. The figure is likely exacerbated by an April 2018 agreement that allows background check information, including immigration status, of caregivers like parents and relatives to be shared with immigration authorities. McClatchy reported: The new estimate comes as backlash widens over President Donald Trump's' decision to separate parents and children. Advocates argue the growing numbers of unaccounted children should be expected as families and sponsors become more fearful of federal officials that is now using information from government social workers to run immigration checks and, in some cases, target sponsors, including parents and family members, for removal. We have reached out to HHS with a number of questions regarding the care of newly-separated children and the method with which they will be tracked and eventually reunited with parents.

Both the pro- and anti-licensing camps agree that only Florida, Nevada and Louisiana require licenses to practice commercial interior design, and a court upheld the Florida law earlier this month. The state Legislature is trying to remove some of the restrictions on these licenses, but it has not happened yet. So we rate this statement True.","Abhorred by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Republican legislators and even President Barack Obama, regulations have been a popular target of lawmakers this year. Prosperity in the private sector, they say, will come when government removes rules that stifle competition and growth. On Jan. 25, 2011, the House Business and Consumer Affairs Subcommittee heard regulation-related complaints from several pro-business representatives, including Allen Douglas, legislative affairs director for the National Federation of Independent Business' Florida branch. The NFIB is a national association of advocates for small businesses. Douglas focused his complaints on state licenses, particularly those for interior designers. The state issues licenses for many professions, but the interior design license is a hot debate. Proponents say it takes a certified design professional to ensure a commercial space is fit for human needs. Opponents, like the NFIB, argue it should not take several years of experience, education and exams to do the job, and Florida's law is too severe. 'Florida is one of only three states that require licenses for commercial interior designers,' Douglas told the committee. 'The argument will be it's a public safety and health issue. ... If you're in an office building with a lot of cubicles, the aisle ways need to be a certain width, you know, you can't block the fire exits. Well, there's other people in place -- fire marshals, other types of inspectors -- that will take care of that. 'It keeps people out of the industry, because it's very hard to become a commercial interior designer in this state.' Back up: Florida is one of just three states that requires a license for commercial interior designers? That's an exclusive club, if true. We had to give this claim a second look. We started by checking the Florida Statutes, to see whether Florida regulates its commercial interior designers in the first place. The answer is yes. Florida has a 'practice act' that mandates commercial interior designers have licenses. To attain one in Florida, an aspiring designer must achieve six years of education and experience and pass all three portions of the National Council for Interior Design Qualification exam. There is a $125 biennial renewal fee, and continuing education is also required. A practice act is more stringent than title or registration acts in other states, which regulate the profession in name only. Many states have title or registration acts that allow applicants to market themselves as 'certified' or 'registered' interior designers as long as they meet varied exam, education and experience requirements and fees. Earning state approval is a way to give consumers a certain amount of confidence in whom they hire. Next we touched base with Douglas. He says he got involved with Florida's interior design law in 2009, when the NFIB and the Institute for Justice, a national libertarian law firm, filed a federal lawsuit against the state Board of Architecture and Interior Design challenging Florida's practice act. The Institute for Justice put up a YouTube video and statement about Florida's interior design law two years ago, calling the state 'ground zero in the nationwide battle to 'cartel-ize' the interior design industry.' The institute claimed interior design regulations have several consequences, including higher fees and fewer employment opportunities, 'especially for minorities and older mid-career switchers.' On Feb. 4, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida ruled in the NFIB's favor on one part of the lawsuit: A rule that limited the use of 'interior designer' to only those with licenses was unconstitutional. This decision allows unlicensed residential decorators the option to market themselves as 'interior designers.' However, Hinkle upheld Florida's practice act, which governs non-residential designers, as constitutional. The NFIB and Institute for Justice appealed their lawsuit to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Alabama. On March 1, 2011, the appeals court rejected their case in a 24-page document, saying in part it would not 'second-guess the legislature's judgment as to the relative safety justifications versus any burdens imposed on interstate commerce.' The appeals court affirmed the district court's ruling, so Florida's interior design law remains in effect. So, to recap: Interior designers in Florida need a license for jobs that involve commercial spaces, draperies, flooring, clubhouses and swimming pool areas. The license enables them to submit stamped and signed drawing plans and carry out work on design projects. But no one needs a license to offer residential interior design, or services including window treatments and paint. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which oversees the board, sums it up for consumers: 'If you are going to hire someone to design the interior of a commercial structure, he/she needs to be licensed.' But what we wanted to check is whether three states is correct. Douglas pointed us to Patti Morrow, executive director of the Interior Designer Protection Council and a staunch advocate for fewer restrictions on the industry. Morrow tracks interior design legislation for all states on her website. She is sometimes depicted boasting pink boxing gloves, symbolizing her fight against Florida's 'anti-competitive, anti-consumer monopoly' of interior design. She said by phone that four states used to require a license to practice interior design: Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Nevada. But Alabama left the pack when the state Supreme Court ruled its practice act unconstitutional in 2007. So that leaves three. Morrow, who lives in New Hampshire, appeared at an emotional committee meeting of the Florida House, which passed a bill that would roll back regulation of interior designers and 30 other professions, on March 15, 2011. She repeated at that meeting the claim about Florida being one of three states to regulate commercial interior design. We then went to the website of the pro-licensing side, the Interior Design Associations Foundation, which also tracks state legislation, to corroborate the count. The American Society of Interior Designers offers a similar state-by-state view of requirements for interior designers. Check! These groups' practice-act counts match up to Morrow's count of three states. Now, we should mention that while those three states are the only that require 'licenses,' several states - including New York, Kentucky and Alabama -- have education, experience and exam requirements that do not result in a license but grant use of a title. In New York, for instance, a 'certified interior designer' applicant must pay a $377 fee, be at least 21, have at least seven years of acceptable education and experience credits, pass the NCIDQ, and 'be of good moral character.' Douglas said that 'Florida is one of only three states that requires licenses for commercial interior designers. Both the pro- and anti-licensing camps agree that only Florida, Nevada and Louisiana require licenses to practice commercial interior design, and a court upheld the Florida law earlier this month. The state Legislature is trying to remove some of the restrictions on these licenses, but it has not happened yet. So we rate this statement True.",,,,'Florida is one of only three states that require licenses for commercial interior designers.,supported,true,,politifact

Records offered by Goodlatte and other Republicans show Obama repeatedly has made such statements. But the congressman goes a little off course in trying to quantify the times the president has said so. In a handful of the instances, the president was talking in general terms about executive authority that he did not relate to immigration. So in the interest of precision, we rate Goodlatte's claim Mostly True.","U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says it should be a no-brainer for the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down President Barack Obama's stalled program to shield millions of immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally. The high court heard arguments April 19 on whether Obama exceeded his authority in late 2014 by going around Congress and launching the program via executive order. Goodlatte, in a statement issued the day of the hearing, said the court should be guided by the past words of the president himself. 'Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own,' said Goodlatte, R-6th. Obama's program would delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for at least three years. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program. The president announced the program Nov. 20, 2014, after House Republicans didn't act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Twenty-six states, not including Virginia, have sued to stop the program and have won before a federal district court judge in Texas and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We decided to examine Goodlatte's claim that Obama said 22 times that he lacked the power to change immigration laws by himself. It's a claim that's been made by many Republicans. The source, according to Goodlatte's statement, is a list blogged on Nov. 19, 2014, by then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Let's first discuss the problems with Boehner's list. Four of the quotes Boehner cited do not mention immigration but were general statements Obama made as a candidate for president about limiting the use of executive orders - a power he accused his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, of abusing. In another quote flagged by Boehner, Obama actually was talking about his inability to end the military's now-defunct 'don't ask, don't tell' policies on homosexuality. That leaves, by our count, 17 Obama statements on the list that go to the heart of Goodlatte's claim. Here's a sampling: March 28, 2011 During a town hall meeting at Bell Multicultural High School in the District of Columbia, Obama was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea. Obama said, 'With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed - and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard, so you know that we've got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch's job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. 'There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who've engaged in criminal activity.' Jan. 30, 2013 During an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants. The president said, 'Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said, I think, previously, I'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law. And that's what we've done. But what I've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That's the reason that we've moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law, we said we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here, for example.' Feb. 14, 2013 Obama was asked during a Google+ Hangout, by a woman named Jackie, if he would be willing to take executive action on immigration to ensure 'families are not split apart.' Obama said, 'Well look Jackie, this is something I've struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress, right now, has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system, and what that means is we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think in many cases the results may be tragic. 'And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we are focusing our enforcement resources on criminals as opposed to someone who is just here and trying to work and look after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated, and what we've done is obviously passed a deferred action which made sure the dreamers - young people who were brought here and think of themselves as American are American, except for their papers - that they are not deported. Having said all that, we've kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. That's why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important.' Sept. 17, 2013 Obama was interviewed by Jose Diaz-Balart, anchor for Noticias Telemundo. The broadcaster asked the president if he would 'consider unilaterally freezing deportations for the parents of deferred-action kids' - a term that generally refers to people who came to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, attend school or have graduated, and have not committed criminal offenses. Obama said, 'Here's the problem that I have, Jose, and I've said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said, 'Here's the law when it comes to those who are undocumented,' and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement, and what I have been able to do is make a legal argument, that I think is absolutely right, that given the resources that we have, we can't do everything that Congress has asked us to do. 'What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome.

On Nov. 18, 2014 - two days before Obama announced his immigration program - White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president altered his view on his executive power after conferring with the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security on 'what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address.' The White House argued before the Supreme Court that the 26 states contesting Obama's program have no legal standing to sue, because immigration policy is the domain of the federal government and that no laws have been broken. The Obama administration also argued that it merely is setting policies - not establishing laws - on whom to deport.

While some readers were skeptical about the fantastical story, The Oatmeal provided a link to its source material, Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry, which recounts the incident at length in Chapter 5.Although The Oatmeal described Roddenberry as the 'co-pilot' of the flight, other sources identified Roddenberry as the 'third officer without flight responsibilities' or 'a deadheading' pilot. Nonetheless, Roddenberry did helm a portion the flight while the captain took a break, and there's no disputing the fact that he helped 22 people survive the crash of Pan Am Flight 121 in 1947 after an engine fire forced the flight down in a desert and the plane ignited:The flight's Third Officer, Eugene Wesley Roddenberry, of River Edge, New Jersey, purser Anthony Volpe and stewardess Jane Bray helped evacuate the wrecked airliner. 'We who could jumped out. The other survivors were handed down and we dragged them away and tried to do what we could for them. We had to carry the Rani away. She had a head injury and had lost some teeth and was in a rather bad way, but we finally quieted her,' Bray recalled. 'All we could do then was watch while the plane burned, slowly at first and then fiercely. It must have burned for hours, but I do not remember too well. There wasn't any sound but those flames. Everybody who died must have been killed outright.'As described in Star Trek Creator, Roddenberry was instrumental in helping to save surviving passengers:The second the plane came to a rest, Roddenberry, Volpe, and Bray quickly began evacuating their charges through the ruptured fuselage. As the fire in the front of the plane approached their section, they knew they only had seconds to get everyone out. Moving as fast as they could, they pushed open the cabin door and guided the uninjured passengers out. Gene and Tony handed down the injured, then the uninjured passengers on the ground dragged them to safety. Even with the composed and focused actions of the surviving crew, the evacuation did not go smoothly. After most of the passengers had been removed, the seatbelt of the Majarani of Pheleton would not release, trapping her in the burning wreckage. The large woman was hysterical. Gene forced the belt open and rescued the Indian royal. She and her son, the prince, were put with the others on the sand, away from the plane and the fire. Gene pulled out several people who were themselves on fire and used a pillow he found on the ground to smother the flames. On board, the flames were growing in intensity, so he could only make a couple of trips into the passenger compartment. The last passenger he pulled out died in his arms. The wind changed, blowing the burning gasoline directly over the ship's wreckage; Gene and Volpe were unable to rescue any more passengers out of the plane. The other passengers safe for the moment, the trio turned their thoughts to their friends on the flight deck. They ran around the burning fuselage and wings to the front of the plane. Looking in the cockpit windows, they could see the flight crew sitting at their stations, slumped over their seats, dead or unconscious. Frantically pounding on the windows, Volpe, Bray, and Roddenberry tried to rouse their friends until the flames drove them back.The Roddenberry Foundation recounted a similar version of the story, noting that the creator of Star Trek was awarded a Civil Aeronautics commendation for his efforts after the crash:At war's end, he joined Pan American World Airways. It was on a flight from Calcutta that his plane lost two engines and caught fire in flight, crashing at night in the Syrian desert. As the senior surviving officer, Roddenberry sent two Englishmen swimming across the Euphrates River in quest of the source of a light he had observed just prior to the crash impact. The Englishmen reached a Syrian military outpost, which sent a small plane to investigate. Roddenberry returned with the small plane to the outpost, where he broadcast a message that was relayed to Pan Am, which sent a stretcher plane to the rescue. Roddenberry later received a Civil Aeronautics commendation for his efforts during and after the crash.",Star Wreck,Web comic rekindles interest in 'Star Trek' creator Gene Roddenberry's experience surviving a Pan Am plane crash and fire in 1947.,,Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry survived a plane crash in 1947.,supported,TRUE,"<p> The second the plane came to a rest, Roddenberry, Volpe, and Bray quickly began evacuating their charges through the ruptured fuselage.

John Cox Candidate for California governor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJB2jix_f-U Monday, April 23, 2018 2018-04-23 Read More info","Did Travis Allen, arguably the most conservative candidate for California governor, donate campaign money to three of the state's leading liberal Democrats? That's the Republican-on-Republican attack levied by John Cox's campaign for governor in a recent TV ad that goes after Allen, an Orange County assemblyman who's positioned himself as a GOP populist. Here's the full text of the ad, which includes three attacks on Allen: Narrator: 'For Republicans, the race for governor is crystal clear: There's conservative businessman John Cox, leading the opposition to Jerry Brown's Sanctuary State and chairman of the initiative campaign to repeal the gas tax. Then there's career politician Travis Allen. He gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown. Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer. And on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens. The conservative choice is clear: John Cox for governor.' The ad was paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018. We'll examine the other two attacks on Allen in future fact-checks. In this piece, we'll focus on the claim he donated to top Democrats. Background on GOP rivals Recent polls show growing support for Cox's campaign for governor, less than a week after President Trump endorsed the San Diego businessman. A survey released Wednesday night from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Newsom, the state's lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent, State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent. Cox and Allen have sparred at campaign events over who is the most conservative candidate. They've both criticized California's Democratic leadership over the gas tax increase and sanctuary state protections. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Donating to Democrats? The ad accuses Allen of donating to three of the state's top Democrats. The irony, of course, is that Allen's run for governor has centered on criticizing those same politicians, particularly Brown and Newsom. We found clear evidence supporting the claim, though Cox's ad ignores the fact that the contributions took place nearly a decade ago, before Allen ran for elected office, and that he also donated to Republicans. Campaign finance records show that in October 2010, Allen donated $1,000 to Jerry Brown for Governor, through Wealth Strategies Group, his wealth management firm in Huntington Beach. In August 2010, Allen gave $100 to Gavin Newsom for Lieutenant Governor. And, in October 2010, he donated $250 to Barbara Boxer for Senate. SOURCE: Campaign finance records from the California Secretary of State's website. Asked about this, a spokeswoman for Allen's campaign said in an email that the contributions took place 'before Travis was an elected official, as a businessman, he purchased tickets to some events.' A November 2017 Mercury-News article summarized these and additional donations Allen made to Democrats in 2010 and 2011. He told the paper at that time: 'As a businessman I was invited to some events by friends, and I purchased tickets to these events. Attending these events, however, opened my eyes to the damage the Democrats were doing to California, and brought about my decision to do everything in my power to stop them, including running for public office.' Similar claim In April 2016, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True a similar claim about then Presidential candidate Donald Trump donating to Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, at the time Trump's rival for the Republican presidential nomination, claimed Trump 'has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris.' Campaign finance data showed the claim was accurate, though we noted Cruz left out that the donations took place long before Trump announced his run for president. The contribution to Jerry Brown took place in 2006, while the donations to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013.",,,,"Republican candidate for California governor Travis Allen 'gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Bush, fixed very few homes in the months since Hurricane Harvey slapped ashore in August 2017. Patterson, otherwise confirming his 2018 candidacy for land commissioner, a post he previously held for 12 years, said in a recent interview that the Bush-led General Land Office hadn't accomplished much in the way of hurricane relief. On Dec. 8, 2017, Patterson said to Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman: 'I mean, who the hell's in charge here? And now we have tens of thousands of Texans who are essentially homeless and the land office has repaired two--two homes. And we've got folks waking up that have been sleeping in tents and they got snow this morning. People are still sleeping in tents.' Patterson's comment seemed potent given that the GLO announced in September 2017 it was teaming with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hasten post-Harvey recovery in part by helping eligible survivors begin to patch up their homes--though full rebuilds weren't in the mix. Bush said at the time: 'With the magnitude of the damage from Hurricane Harvey, there is no doubt this will require a long recovery. This agreement marks the beginning of a new model for simplifying and expediting the transition out of sheltering to short-term and long-term housing recovery efforts.' We focused this fact-check on Patterson's insistence the GLO had only repaired two homes. Homeless--and tents? But Patterson's other pokes also got our attention. How many Texans remain homeless due to the hurricane is hard to pin, we recently found. But a University of Texas expert, Gordon Wells, has estimated, based on flood insurance claims and satellite imagery, that at the least, more than 1 million Texas homes sustained flood damage though he told us that count could exceed 1.7 million. After Patterson spoke, we queried government officials about survivors in tents. By phone, the GLO's Pete Phillips said some Aransas County residents, resistant to options such as out-of-town hotels, were residing in tents. Similarly, Bob Howard of FEMA's Harvey response team responded by email: 'Every effort is made to ensure survivors are aware of available local, state and federal resources. Thus far, all tent-dwellers found by the field team have indicated they prefer to remain in their current status or are not eligible for federal disaster assistance.' Now let's turn to Patterson's focus on homes repaired with government help since Harvey and related rains flooded much of Southeast Texas. Patterson points to federal program We asked Patterson the basis of his numerical claim; he told us by phone that he was referring to two homes repaired as of early December 2017 through the federal Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair (DALHR) program. Patterson, who said he'd drawn his tally of two from state-enlisted contractors and others he declined to identify, urged us to seek insight from elected leaders in counties hit by Harvey. We heard back from elected officials in two counties. Galveston County's county judge, Mark Henry, said by phone that flooding due to Harvey had flooded 22,000 to 24,000 local homes with water an inch to eight feet deep. Henry, who volunteered that he's a longtime friend to Patterson, said his office daily fields calls from residents awaiting help. Calling delayed repairs 'frustrating,' Henry said: 'As far as the why' repairs have been delayed, Henry said, 'I don't know and I don't care. I want it to get done.' By email, a GLO spokeswoman, Brittany Eck, specified that as of mid-December 2017, the agency along with FEMA had housed 56 Galveston County 'applicant households and 446 are in the process of receiving a direct housing solution.' Also by phone, Loyd Neal, Nueces County's judge, expressed chagrin that no agency advanced dollars enabling the Coastal Bend Council of Governments to hire individuals to consider applicants for short-term housing help. By email, Eck countered that the GLO had guaranteed up to $200,000 in reimbursed administrative costs to the regional councils asked to help administer post-Harvey housing assistance. Eck said that after the Coastal Bend council declined to participate, GLO employees were carrying out the program in that region. Neal told us that nearly four months since Harvey's arrival, FEMA-funded housing including trailers or manufactured homes had yet to be brought into Port Aransas, the island tourist town where, Neal elaborated, more than two-thirds of local hurricane-damaged condominiums had yet to reopen. 'It's an absolute disgrace,' Neal said, 'that the state of Texas and the federal government and whoever else is in charge of this have not responded. It's the greatest bureaucratic buck-passing I've ever seen.' By email, Eck said that per FEMA in December 2017, 52 Nueces County households were in need of direct housing assistance. Correct count, but... We confirmed Patterson's count of two homes whose DALHR repair projects had been completed with Eck and Phillips, a land office administrator. But those officials said Patterson's claim gave short shrift to everything Harvey-related that Bush and the land office have undertaken and, Phillips said, to FEMA's supervisory governing role. 'He is oversimplifying what is going on,' Phillips said, and 'cherry-picking' given that the federal government supports housing options including thousands of hotel rooms, two types of home repair and possibly temporary apartments or trailers or manufactured homes. At the state level too, Phillips elaborated, 'we're always at the mercy of FEMA. They control the triage process' including, Eck said, confidential lists of homeowners for GLO to contact about their possibly seeking partial repairs backed by federal aid. Patterson, commenting on Phillips' general assessment of his claim, said by email that 'to be clear, I made a statement, and it turned out to be 100% factually accurate. None of the 'context' or 'cherry-picking' BS need apply.' DALHR in Texas In November 2017, Bush announced the completion of the first DALHR home-repair project in Dickinson, in Galveston County. A GLO press release said the project included electrical and plumbing repairs, wall insulation, sheet rock, siding repair and replacing kitchen and bathroom sinks and a bathtub. That release said DALHR 'provides permanent repairs for homeowners with moderate damages who lack available housing resources.' But not everybody qualifies, the release made clear, in that beneficiaries must have sustained a FEMA-verified loss of $17,000 or more after 18 inches of interior flooding or more--though Phillips told us the GLO later encouraged FEMA to drop the 18-inch requirement, a change that qualified an additional 2,600 homes for consideration. According to the release, interested homeowners had to clear another half dozen hurdles such as a lack of other applicable insurance coverage and that eligible damages wouldn't exceed $60,000 or half the pre-hurricane taxable assessed value of the home. Then again, Eck told us by email, the latter limit was subsequently relaxed to allow awards to pay for up to half of a home's replacement value. The November release also said that funded repairs under DALHR 'are limited to real property components such as heating, plumbing, ventilation and air conditioning, walls, floors and ceilings,' leaving our structural or engineering needs or any items covered by other aid. Varied aid offerings Let's walk through some more of what the GLO and FEMA described as the programs they're steering to Harvey survivors. Notably, Phillips said, and FEMA's Howard confirmed, the teaming of the state agency with FEMA to coordinate short-term housing aid marked the first time a state agency had been given that front-line role. Eck said Gov. Greg Abbott 'tapped the GLO to help FEMA implement these programs three weeks after the storm, in part due to the enormity of the affected area. In all cases, the applicant must be approved for eligibility by FEMA and, if interested, agree to the terms of FEMA's regulations. The GLO is processing eligible applicants for short-term housing programs as FEMA is making their information available to the agency,' Eck wrote. By email, Eck wrote that individuals displaced by the hurricane and its aftermath were offered federally funded hotel stays by FEMA while they looked for longer-term housing. 'This program is currently housing 15,027 individuals in 1,334 hotels,' Eck said. 'None of the programs provided by FEMA are designed to be a permanent home replacement or complete repair program,' Eck added. 'The programs are designed to be short-term (up to 18 months) stopgap solutions while individuals work on long-term solutions.' Starting Nov. 18, 2017, Eck wrote, the agency through early December 2017 had contacted 664 households judged by FEMA to be potentially qualified for the program. She said those contacts led to 290 expressions of interest and 182 DALHR home inspections--with 67 homes pre-qualified for repairs and 13 work orders issued for builders to start. 'To date, two homes have had the work completed,' Eck wrote. By email. FEMA's Howard wrote: 'We believe it is two projects at this point.' Phillips said by phone that his DALHR goal was to complete more than 100 home projects by 2018; he said 36 builders were standing by ready to do the 're-work' on homes. Meantme, Phillips said, over 670 Texas families had received direct housing help by landing a trailer or manufactured home. At our request, FEMA's Howard emailed us that agency's daily Harvey fact sheet from the date that Patterson made his claim stating that 638 Texas families by then had been provided a trailer or manufactured home. As of mid-December, Howard told us by email, 8,057 Harvey survivors in the state still showed a need for a trailer or manufactured home and, he said, 2,600 of them remained under review for DAHLR aid. Otherwise, Phillips said, the GLO helped make available 40 apartment units in Wharton and also found 120 units of 'corporate housing' to be made available in Conroe, in both cases under FEMA-backed programs. Howard said that generally by Dec. 14, 2017, 894,606 Texas residents had registered for Harvey-tired FEMA assistance of one kind or another. Another Patterson-cited program Patterson further told us the GLO had failed to help Texans benefit from another FEMA offering, the Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program, which provides up to $20,000 enabling homeowners to shelter in their homes thanks to limited repairs and the restoration of power. Eck said by email that PREPS aid was being offered by FEMA separately in that beneficiaries need a local government to provide a 10 percent match for an award to be made. By phone, meantime, Phillips said GLO officials had judged PREPS to be of limited value because families getting awards end up practically camping at home. The DALHR program, Phillips said, gets families 'close to being whole.'",,,,Says the Texas General Land Office led by George P.

The article said the Trump-branded enterprise had been hastily ensconced in an existing, never-completed hotel building: It is the first Western hotel to open in the secretive country, which is often called the 'Hermit Kingdom.' 'You know, they tell me this is the finest hotel in, literally, all of Asia. You can't beat it. And it serves the most delicious tacos,' Trump told reporters. 'Highly recommended for journalists when they go to cover the denuclearization of North Korea!' Kim, who was standing next to Trump, said nothing and smiled. The new franchise was rapidly constructed inside the existing Ryugyong Hotel, a massive 1,000-foot tall glass pyramid that sits in the heart of Pyongyang. The hotel was empty until recently, although it has been under construction for more than thirty years. Foreigners nicknamed the empty building the 'Hotel of Doom.' But although the ill-fated Ryugyong Hotel does exist in downtown Pyongyang (and is popularly known outside North Korea as the 'hotel of doom'), there have been no mainstream news reports of its being rebranded as a Trump property, nor any evidence that the president issued a public statement praising the hotel's tacos. In point of fact, the article is an obvious spoof on the aggrandizing hype surrounding the Trump/Kim summit, not least Trump's own claim that he enticed Kim Jong Un to give up nuclear missile testing by promising that North Korea could have 'the best hotels in the world' instead.

16490,3847,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rfk-jr-supreme-court/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In late March and early April 2021, identically phrased social media posts started repeating a confused collection of made-up quotes and dubious legal and medical claims involving Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the United States Supreme Court. These posts, examples of copy-pasted social media text sometimes referred to as copypasta, generally begin with the same statement: SUBJECT: A BIG VICTORY FOR FREEDOM IN THE UNITED STATES. The Supreme Court overturned universal vaccination. US infectious disease specialist Bill Gates, Fauci, and Big Pharma lost a US Supreme Court case, failing to prove all of their vaccines over the past 32 years were safe for the health of citizens! The lawsuit was filed by a group of scientists led by Senator [sic] Kennedy. Most, but not all, versions of this copypasta typically include a quote, purportedly from Robert F. Kennedy Jr, about mRNA vaccines: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: 'The new COVID vaccine must be avoided at all costs. I urgently draw your attention to important issues related to the next vaccination against Covid-19. For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called latest-generation mRNA vaccines directly interfere with the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which is genetic manipulation, which was already prohibited and was previously considered to be a crime. Kennedy, who has never been a senator, never made the above statement, nor did he win a Supreme Court case regarding 'universal vaccination.' Further, the Supreme Court has not appreciably 'overturned' any vaccination precedent in over a century, and mRNA vaccines do not 'alter an individual's genetic material.' In reality, these 2021 viral posts on social media are an amalgamation of misleading viral claims derived from an anti-vaccine group's 2018 settlement of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit and from a bit of copypasta that went viral in October and November 2020. 'Supreme Court Overturned Universal Vaccination' The Supreme Court has never ruled on 'universal vaccination.' The Supreme Court's position on 'compulsory vaccination' - the idea that a state has the power to compel vaccination through fines, civil penalties, or exclusion from certain public services like schools - was set well over a century ago and has not been 'overturned.' In the 1905 case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court ruled that, 'It is within the police power of a State to enact a compulsory vaccination law.' Even though it is old, as the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health explained in November 2020, 'this continues to be the benchmark case on the state's power to mandate vaccination.' The 'lawsuit filed by a group of scientists led by ... Kennedy' that allegedly demonstrated that the U.S government is 'failing to prove all of their vaccines over the past 32 years were safe' refers to a case in the Southern District of New York between the anti-vaccine Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that was settled in 2018. That case revolved around a FOIA request made by ICAN for congressionally mandated biennial safety reports about vaccines. Their FOIA search turned up no records, and ICAN - with Kennedy's help - fought for a settlement in which the HHS stated that fact in writing. That case has been used to assert, falsely, that no safety testing on vaccines has been, or is being, completed. Regardless, it was not a Supreme Court case, and it did not overturn the Supreme Court precedent set in Jacobson v. Massachusetts. 'RFK Jr: The New COVID Vaccine Must Be Avoided at all Costs' Kennedy has a long and well-documented history of making false and conspiratorial claims about vaccines. His Instagram page, which spread unhinged claims about 5G wireless technology, Bill Gates, and microchips, was banned in February 2020 for spreading vaccine misinformation. That being said, the quote from Kennedy is apocryphal. It first appeared in a copypasta post Snopes debunked in November 2020. With respect to the quote about how the vaccine should be avoided at all costs because 'mRNA vaccines directly interfere with the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material,' Kennedy told us that: 'I never made those underlying assertions [in the viral post] and I don't believe them to be factually accurate. ... Many forums have reposted it and we have been playing whack-a-mole trying to get them to remove it.' In fact, mRNA vaccines, as we explained in our earlier fact check, do not alter a human's genetic code and are incapable of doing so, as the material injected is physically unable to cross into the nucleus of a cell. That article also covers several other false scientific claims sometimes included with the 'Supreme Court overturned universal vaccination' post. Because no statement in the viral hodgepodge of misinformation that went viral in March and April 2021 is factual, its assertion that Kennedy overturned a Supreme Court precedent regarding vaccines is 'False.'",Did RFK Jr. Win a Supreme Court Case Against Mandatory Vaccination? Two false rumors combined do not make a truth.

8846,14153,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/leland-melvin-pen-open-letter-donald-trump/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"As tensions rose in September 2017 in response to football players' protesting police brutality and inequality by kneeling during the U.S. national anthem, astronaut and former football player Leland Melvin jumped into the fray with a lengthy open letter to president Donald Trump. During a September speech in Alabama, Trump had called for a boycott of the National Football League (NFL), saying: Wouldn't you love one of the NFL owners when someone disrespects our flag, 'get that son of a bitch off the field right now' . . . If you see it, leave the stadium, I guarantee things will stop. Trump's words heightened emotions on both sides of the issue, but for athletes and team owners, it seemed to heighten solidarity and even spread the protest to as quarterback Tom Brady and National Basketball Association players Steph Curry and Lebron James spoke out against Trump. Amidst all this, a lengthy open letter to the President purportedly penned by astronaut and former NFL Player Leland Melvin came to light: To Donald Trump I believe in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this country even though at the time they were drafted, their tenets of life, liberty justice for all and eventual freedom of speech, religion, assembly, press and petition amendment ratified in Dec 1791, only applied to a select group of people and not ones that looked like me. Donald Trump I listened to your Alabama rally rant and could not believe how easily you say what you say. We have become numb to your outlandish acts, tweets and recent retweet of you knocking down Hillary Clinton with a golf ball that you hit. Donald Trump your boorish and disgusting actions are not funny. They actually promote violence against women especially when your followers act out what you say. I used to walk the grounds of UVA in Charlottesville, VA as a graduate student only to watch in horror as those same grounds became a battlefield being trod by Nazi and anti-Semitic worshippers armed with assault style weapons ready to fight to make America White again. (their words). You actually said there were nice people on both sides. People armed and ready to kill other Americans for the purpose of eradicating Blacks, Jews, Hispanics, Mexicans, Asians, Latinas and even the first real Americans, Native Americans to make America Great Again were 'nice people'? Verses what you say in condemnation of an unarmed black man peacefully protesting by exercising his constitutional First Amendment rights by silently taking a knee is appalling, unnerving and reprehensible. You called Colin Kaepernick 'a son-of-a-bitch.' And said he should be fired. You are basically calling his white mother a bitch. The strong contrast in language for a black man and a Nazi is very telling. Do you have any sense of decency or shame in what you say to the American people that are part of your duty to serve respectfully with dignity, presidentially? The National Anthem that we listen too has been edited to try not to offend because when Francis Scott Key penned the song he watched freed slaves fighting for the British and wrote this stanza: 'And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.' I guess if I were a slave back then I probably would have done anything to obtain freedom from my American oppressors who were whipping, killing, raping, dismembering, hanging or releasing the dogs on people like me all under our Constitution. In 1814 former slaves fought with the British for their freedom from their American enslavers and Key witnessed a battle from a ship off the Maryland shore at Fort McHenry which inspired him to write what became our National Anthem. I served my country not in the military but as 1 of 362 American Astronauts that have explored the universe to help advance our civilization. Not just Americans but all humans. I also was briefly in the NFL and stood for the National Anthem with my hand over my heart. What makes us great is our differences and respecting that we are all created equally even if not always treated that way. Looking back at our planet from space really helps one get a bigger perspective on how petty and divisive we can be. Donald Trump maybe you should ask your good friend Mr. Putin to give you a ride on a Soyuz rocket to our International Space Station and see what it's like to work together with people we used to fight against, where your life depends on it. See the world and get a greater sense of what it means to be part of the human race, we call it the Orbital Perspective. Donald Trump please know that you are supposed to be a unifier and a compassionate and empathetic leader. If you can't do the job then please step down and let someone else try. I pray that you do the right thing. May God bless you. Sincerely, Leland Melvin Former Astronaut and NFL Player It's unclear why this particular response was met with skepticism, but several readers wrote in to ask us if the letter was authentic. It's possible that many were unfamiliar with Melvin. Some may have also questioned the authenticity of the national anthem stanza mentioned by the former NFL Player (it is indeed part of the song). The length of Melvin's post, which was significantly longer than most of the other responses that circulated on social media, may have also raised some doubts.

The above-displayed 1962 magazine advertisement for Humble Oil & Refining Company and Enco brand gasoline is a prime example of this concept.Back in the early 1960s ad copy such as the following, which touted an oil company's size and technical efficiency by boasting that its output could melt several tons of glacier every day, would have raised no eyebrows:EACH DAY HUMBLE SUPPLIES ENOUGH ENERGY TO MELT 7 MILLION TONS OF GLACIER! This giant glacier has remained unmelted for centuries. Yet, the petroleum energy Humble supplies - if converted into heat - could melt it at the rate of 80 tons each second!

Nor could those ad men have anticipated that melting glaciers would become one of the most common symbols used to illustrate the perils the world would have to confront if scientific predictions about global warming proved to be true.Some viewers have doubted that this purported 1960s advertisement is real, believing it instead to be a modern effort created for satirical or political purposes.

18054,5874,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sharia-law-texas/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 27 January 2015, the website Breitbart published an article titled 'ISLAMIC TRIBUNAL CONFIRMED IN TEXAS; ATTORNEY CLAIMS 'IT'S VOLUNTARY.'' While the article's details were novel, the premise was not: A number of locations in the U.S. (Dearborn, Michigan, is frequently mentioned) have been rumored to be partially or fully subject to 'Sharia law' enforcement. The claim also echoed the discredited belief in so-called 'no-go zones' exist in the United States and Europe, where law enforcement agencies refuse to tread and immigrants who favor Islamic law have created a de facto parallel system of justice. The Breitbart article began by stating that '[the existence of] an Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas' had been 'confirmed' by the site, that the tribunal was 'operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas,' and that it was 'voluntary' in nature. It went on to discuss potential conflicts between the tribunal and state law in Texas, making particular note of possible social sanctions for not abiding by the decisions rendered: Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. [Dr. Taher] El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, 'we follow Sharia law.' However, he explained, 'If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal's decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.' He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the 'judge's' decision would be. El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings. The claim was recirculated by readers and other blogs, many of whom inferred (in part due to the insinuation the rulings were somehow binding in a way the tribunal would not disclose) the service in question superseded local, state, or federal law. One such version voiced concern over the purpose of such an organization: An Islamic Tribunal that uses Sharia as the basis for law, not the US Constitution, the Bible nor the Texas State Constitution has been set up as a non-profit organization in Dallas. The tribunal claims that, for the most part, Sharia is in agreement with the laws of Texas. Price was told by El-badawi that if the tribunal ruled in a way in which the parties disagreed, then they could go to the Texas courts, which makes you wonder why one would have this tribunal in the first place. The source article linked to the tribunal's web site, which explained the center's intent and scope: Conflicting problems within American Muslim society may range from personal and family matters such as marriage and divorce, as well as disputes among community members and those in positions of leadership. The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers. Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment. It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective. These proceedings must be conducted in accordance with the law of the land; local, state and federal within the United States. Through effective mediation and arbitration, decisions can be made that are stipulated in the Shari'ah and adhering to the binding, ethical and legal code that exists within this country with the final approval of the relevant courts and judges. The Islamic Tribunal seeks support and guidance from consultants and counselors to its attorneys to ensure that local, state and federal law are strictly conformed to and decisions that originate from the Tribunal are in accordance with said laws. While its stated purpose is religious in nature (and specific to Islam), the practice described is neither new nor unusual. Mediation and arbitration are common practices to circumvent the escalation of disputes to civil court, often employed by people facing a family law issue (such as a pending divorce or the details of a child custody agreement). In business arrangements, parties frequently sign agreements mandating disputes first go to arbitration before any legal action is taken. Disputes resolved through mediation or arbitration are not enforceable unless confirmed by a court, and even decisions reached by binding arbitration (which the Texas Islamic tribunal does not claim to render) can be challenged: A binding arbitration decision becomes legally enforceable when it is confirmed by a court. If a party believes that either the arbitration agreement itself is unfair (or unconscionable) or the manner in which the arbitration agreement is presented or administered is unconscionable, the arbitration decision may be challenged in court at the confirmation/vacatur hearing. A court will strike any portion of an arbitration agreement it finds unconscionable, and may even void (or vacate) the arbitration decision altogether and release the parties from the agreement. Furthermore, the Islamic Tribunal in Dallas is by no means the only faith-based mediation entity operating in the United States. One such mediation service with a Christian focus describes their service thusly on their web site: Peacemaker Ministries is a non-profit, non-denominational ministry whose mission is to equip and assist Christians and their churches to respond to conflict biblically. We provide conflict coaching, mediation and arbitration services to help resolve lawsuits, family conflicts, business disputes, and church divisions. Our training services include seminars, conflict coaching training, mediation training, advanced mediation and arbitration training for conciliators and church leaders working within their churches, as well as training for individuals conducting more formal and complex proceedings. Similar mediation centers provide such services to Jews: The dayanim who sit on cases include leading authorities on Jewish law, as well as lawyers and businessmen who are familiar with secular law and contemporary commercial practices. When appropriate, the Beth Din will either include expert professionals on an arbitration panel, or consult them as expert witnesses. Cases are decided under Jewish law, through the prism of contemporary commercial practice and secular law. Prior to having a case heard by the Beth Din, litigants are required to enter into a binding arbitration agreement. The Beth Din conducts its proceedings in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of secular arbitration law, so that the rulings of the Beth Din are legally binding and enforceable in the secular court system. So while there is an Islamic mediation center in Dallas, the tribunal neither possessed nor claimed any ability to supersede extant laws in its jurisdiction, either civil or criminal. Parties are not obligated to participate in the mediation it offers, nor does the center have any power to operate outside the law or enforce any settlements it may reach. Similar faith-based mediation centers are offered as an alternative to costly litigation, but ultimately, all citizens and residents of the United States are subject to the laws of its jurisdictions, and no such entity has the ability to override existing laws or enforce illegal contracts or agreements. Dallas' D Magazine published an article that addressed various political responses to the media controversy over the Islamic mediation center, including the Irving City Council's voting in favor of a bill 'that would forbid such tribunals from using foreign law in their rulings (which is already illegal)': A few facts worth noting: Most important, the tribunal is not affiliated with the Islamic Center. Imam Zia is one of four members who constitute the tribunal. Its official address is in North Dallas, but the tribunal meets about twice a month for hearings wherever they can find a suitable office (usually in Arlington). Second: despite [Mayor] Van Duyne's claims, the city of Irving has taken no stance on the center or the tribunal (which, again, isn't even in Irving). It did issue a statement saying that the city wants residents to obey the law and that Irving 'is proud to have one of the most diverse ZIP codes in the United States.' The Houston Chronicle dubbed rumors about Sharia courts '2015 Texas Hoax of the Year,' making many of the same points about it that we did: An Islamic tribunal does operate in the Dallas area, and has done so for several years. But the imams that run the panel do not usurp state or federal law. What exists is a forum where Islamic scholars help settle business disputes and other non-criminal matters. The rulings are nonbinding and work within the guidelines of U.S. law. This is explicitly stated on the tribunal's website: 'These proceedings must be conducted in accordance with the law of the land; local, state and federal within the United States.' Similar religious mediation services exist throughout the U.S. - for Christians, Jews and other devout worshipers - as a way to avoid heading to a civil court. These panels prevent private matters from turning into expensive, public affairs. Since 1925, when Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act, U.S. law has been very open to the idea of private dispute resolution, said Lee Ann Bambach, a Georgia-based attorney who has a Ph. D in religion from Emory University. Her dissertation was titled 'Faith-Based Arbitration by Muslims in an American Context.' 'Those who would jump up and down about these so-called Sharia courts, which are really just alternative dispute resolution forums, will speak very highly of Christian reconciliation,' which is based on Biblical teachings, Bambach said. The Islamic tribunals can benefit Muslim women by allowing them to receive a religious divorce. A women can receive a divorce from a U.S. civil court, but if she wants to remarry in the faith, then a religious divorce is warranted. In cases where the husband does not want to grant a divorce, a Muslim woman can make a case to a tribunal, but they are not always granted. Religious courts in Catholicism and Judaism perform similar acts for observers. Still, a number of right-wing lawmakers have tried to pass either toothless or unconstitutional bills targeting the Islamic tribunals. They do so without any evidence that Sharia Law is causing an issue in their district.",Was Sharia Law Established in Texas?

We rate them Pants on Fire!,"The $2 trillion economic relief package that President Donald Trump signed March 27 is aimed at giving aid to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But some widely shared posts on Facebook claim the legislation helps Congress more than workers. While the stimulus, officially known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, will dole out $1,200 checks to every adult making less than $75,000 per year, a March 26 post says the cash is pennies compared to the pay raise that legislators are giving themselves. 'Congress wants $25 million for raises. That's $46,700 each,' the text post reads. 'Now who's thinking of you.' Another post, published March 20, asserts that the House of Representatives voted to award its members an extra $8,000 per month instead of giving aid to senior citizens. A March 25 post is even more specific, claiming the congressional pay raise is on page 134 of the stimulus.

The legislation offers economic support in the form of small business loans, tax cuts, and health-related spending. In addition to sending cash to everyday Americans, the law will give aid to the airline industry, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. We've seen a lot of misinformation about the stimulus, so we wanted to look into these Facebook posts to see if there's any truth to them. While the CARES Act does allocate money to some Capitol employees, there is nothing in the legislation that gives a pay raise to members of Congress. Several fact-checkers have debunked the claim. 'The CARES Act does not provide either a pay raise or any funding for Member salaries,' said Evan Hollander, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, in an email. 'Likewise, no version of the legislation - House or Senate - ever included provisions for a Member pay raise or funding for salaries.' We checked page 134 of the stimulus package as it appeared on March 25, when one of the Facebook posts was published. It contains information about grants given to states that have 'short-time compensation programs,' which are alternatives to layoffs for employers that experience a reduction in available work. Under the programs, employees who have their hours cut are permitted to collect a percentage of unemployment benefits to make up for lost wages. RELATED: The Senate stimulus bill: What's in it for you The March 25 version of the CARES Act said nothing about pay increases for Congress. Neither does the final version of the stimulus. Hollander said there is $25 million in the stimulus to 'support the House's capability to telework,' including equipment purchases and improvements to the network. There is also money for reimbursing the staff of the House Child Care Center, covering the costs of food service contracts and paying the House sergeant-at-arms. Meanwhile, the Senate is slated to get $10 million from the stimulus. $1 million will go to the sergeant-at-arms to remain available for coronavirus response while $9 million will be reserved for 'miscellaneous items,' including reimbursement for workers at the Senate Employee Child Care Center.

At the time of this writing, the image had been retweeted nearly 10,000 times.

Turtles are the only known animal on Earth to form a shell on the outside of their body through a fusion of modified ribs, vertebrae, and shoulder girdle bones - a process believed to have started some 250 million years ago. In 2008, researchers discovered the fossilized remains of a 220 million-year-old turtle species, Odontochelys semitestacea, in China. The specimen had a fully-developed plastron (the belly area of a turtle's shell) but its partially developed outer shell, known as the carapace, was made up of broadened ribs and vertebrae on its back. Scientists applied this newfound information to a previously discovered South African species known as Eunotosaurus africanus, which was 40 years older and also had 'distinctively broadened ribs.' They found E. africanus was one of the earliest species to form the evolutionary branch of turtles. 'Eunotosaurus neatly fills an approximately 30-55-million year gap in the turtle fossil record,' said Tyler Lyson, then a scientist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, in a news release at the time. 'There are several anatomical and developmental features that indicate Eunotosaurus is an early representative of the turtle lineage; however, its morphology is intermediate between the specialized shell found in modern turtles and primitive features found in other vertebrates. As such, Eunotosaurus helps bridge the morphological gap between turtles and other reptiles.' Current ",Is a Turtle Shell Really Modified Ribs?

Trump's resignation came just as the union leadership was moving to expel Trump in the wake of his alleged provocation of a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The letterhead appeared to carry the logo for what was called the 'Office of the Former President,' created by Trump's team in Palm Beach, Florida, to serve as the official outlet for Trump's statements and to share his future plans. However, now, the stationery on which the letter was submitted says 'Office of Donald J. Trump.' The letter was shared on SAG-AFTRA's website, along with the union's response to Trump, which was a simple, 'Thank you.' As seen in the document, the end of the letter is indeed signed with 'President Donald J. Trump.' In the letter, Trump cited his own acting experience and contributions to television: I'm very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice - to name just a few! I've also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others.

These, however, are policy failures. Your disciplinary failures are even more egregious. I no longer wish to be associated with your union. Professor and author Seth Abramson pointed out how signing the letter this way is 'troubling,' given that Trump is on trial for inciting the riots: Whoa-I just clocked that Trump signed his letter to SAG-AFTRA 'President Donald J.

During the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, as Americans were being increasingly required to wear face masks in order to patronize businesses such as grocery stores, some social media users began circulating images questioning the efficacy of wearing those masks, such as the following: This photograph (and others like it) reflects accurate disclaimers on the packaging of face masks that caution users, 'THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A RESPIRATOR AND WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS) OR OTHER VIRUSES OR CONTAMINANTS.' Such disclaimers do not mean that wearing masks is ineffective at limiting the spread of COVID-19, however, but rather that viewers are misunderstanding the function and purpose of different types of face masks. The type of mask known as a N95 respirator is, in the words of the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), 'a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles': The primary purpose of N95 respirator masks is to protect the wearer from airborne particles (including small aerosol particles), such as those that might cause disease. That is why such masks are worn by health care personnel who are treating patients in a medical setting, to help prevent those personnel from contracting illnesses their patients might spread to them. These masks also, of course, provide some measure of protection for the patients as well: On the other hand, the primary purpose of (cloth) ear loop masks (like the type represented by the picture of packaging seen above) is to protect other people by blocking large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter containing infectious agents that the (infected) wearer might release through coughing, sneezing, talking, and the like. (Although, again, they do provide some small measure of protection to the wearer, but not at nearly as high a level as a respirator mask would.) A Wirecutter article and video explained the difference in these two types of masks: Surgical masks do not protect against viruses. At best, these cloth or latex barriers may help prevent the spread of germs (via coughs or sneezes) when worn by folks who are ill. A properly fitted N95 respirator mask, on the other hand, is far more likely to protect against a virus, as it can filter particulates as small as 0.3 micron. An N95 mask can filter properly only when it has created an airtight seal around your mouth and nose. Health-care workers who may be exposed to pathogens, for example, are required to go through annual N95 fit testing to ensure they are wearing the masks correctly. If you have N95 masks at home and you'd prefer to wear one in public, doing so won't hurt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that members of the public use simple cloth face coverings when in a public setting to slow the spread of the virus, since this will help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. In short, you shouldn't count on ear loop masks to protect you from COVID-19 - you should wear them mainly as a public service to help protect others from you.",Are Non-Respirator Masks Ineffective at Protecting Against COVID-19?

6271,4680,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ufo-pyramid-shaped/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has confirmed that a widely seen, night-vision video showing unidentified, pyramid-shaped flying objects filmed by military personnel aboard the the Navy destroyer USS Russell in July 2019 is authentic. Snopes verified the rumor with the Pentagon after readers asked us to verify social media posts that were reporting the same. Sue Gough, spokeswoman for the DOD, said in an email to Snopes, 'I can confirm that the video was taken by Navy personnel. I have nothing further for you on it.' Although such objects are colloquially referred to as 'UFOs' or 'unidentified flying objects' by the public, the military refers to such objects as 'unidentified aerial phenomena.' In popular culture, UFOs are associated with extraterrestrials. But Jeremy Corbell, the documentary filmmaker who obtained the video, is careful to note that according to his reporting on the subject, their origin and nature are currently unknown to U.S. military officials. The videos showing what appear to be three pyramid-shaped objects were first included in a classified briefing, but the images themselves aren't classified. They were obtained by Corbell and Las Vegas-based news station KLAS'TV's chief investigative reporter George Knapp. They were first reported by KLAS's unexplained phenomena project Mystery Wire, which is run by Knapp. The objects can be seen in Corbell's YouTube video below: The objects, according to Mystery Wire, were hovering about 700 feet over the Navy ship, off the coast of San Diego. In a statement sent to Snopes by text message, Corbell said: I hope these materials can represent a unique moment in modern history, a possible turning point, to allow us to investigate and explore the mystery of UFOs in a rational and transparent way - free of stigma or ridicule. What we are observing in the UFO phenomena requires close inspection - as it certainly represents technology far beyond what the US or any technologically developed nation, currently has within their military arsenal. Gough also confirmed in a statement sent to Fox News that three other photographs of unidentified airborne objects were taken by military aviators. The photographs were taken during flights off the East Coast in 2019. These images were also obtained by Corbell and posted to his Instagram account on April 7, 2021. They can all be seen in the following tweet: So crazy. @G_Knapp released previously unseen military captured UFO / UAP photos yesterday via @MysteryWire. The context behind them is totally insane. Did y'all read his news report? What do you think? Do you want more UFO evidence from our military?@Chieftog 👀#UFO pic.twitter.com/sWXHFBtiLp - Jeremy Corbell (@JeremyCorbell) April 8, 2021 The photographs included in the tweet above were taken on an iPhone by an F-18 fighter jet weapons systems officer, seated behind the pilot on March 4, 2019, according to Mystery Wire. 'I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel,' Gough told Fox News. 'The UAPTF [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force] has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.' In August 2020, the Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to investigate events like these. Defense and intelligence officials are expected to present U.S. senators on intelligence and armed services committees with a report detailing what is known about UFO sightings and an analysis as to whether UFOs pose a threat. Some observers stated that they believe the phenomena can be explained by light distortions from a camera lens, a plane, or drones deployed by adversary countries. We reached out to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to ask whether any weather events in the areas of the phenomena could possibly explain any of them, and we will update this story if we hear back. Knapp reported in an April 6 article posted on Mystery Wire that the objects, encountered on both coasts by military personnel, have continued to baffle military and intelligence officials: 'Many of the objects have been referred to as drones, but that is not what Pentagon investigators have been telling the chain of command behind the scenes.' The photographs and videos obtained by Corbell were included in a series of classified briefings in May 2020 by the Office of Naval Intelligence. 'Whatever they are, they don't know, but they're not ours. That was in the classified briefing,' Corbell, who made the documentary, 'Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers,' told Snopes in a phone interview. The release of the images represented the second time in recent history that the Pentagon confirmed that images of unidentified airborne objects were real and were taken by military personnel. In April 2020, the Department of Defense unclassified three videos of UFOs taken by Navy aviators in 2004 and 2015. One of those aviators, Lt. Commander Chad Underwood, spoke to Corbell in a February 2021 podcast. Underwood said that the object he saw from the cockpit of an F/A-18 Super Hornet in 2004 had no features of any known aircraft - in fact, he said: 'It's featureless. It's just this elongated thing. There's no distinguishing feature that says, 'This is an aircraft.' I have no idea what this thing is.' The two other videos released by the military are dubbed 'Gimbal' and 'Go Fast'; both videos were taken in 2015 by Navy personnel off the coast of Florida. The object described as Gimbal was taken from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. 'Go Fast' was taken by Navy aviators aboard a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt. U.S. senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the chair and vice chair of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence respectively, both commented on the phenomena in general terms in interviews with Mystery Wire. Warner stated, in part, 'It's probably a foreign power,' and added that the U.S. military has changed its footing and now encourages pilots to report phenomena whereas before doing so had been stigmatized. Rubio said: Well I'll comment on what's been in the public domain and what's been discussed publicly in a number of places. The bottom line is that we've had now consistent reports of objects flying over military installations and military training areas, And it's not the U.S. government. And so anytime I see things flying over our military installations that are not ours, we need to know who they are. We need to know why they're there. And that's the way I focus on it. Other people want to speculate about other things that are more exciting, UFOs, aliens, and all this sort of thing. And, you know, we just don't know what it is. I think at a very basic level, if there are things flying over our military installations, or if there's things flying over the skies of the United States, and we don't know what they are, or where they came from, we need to have answers to it. And we need to be working on getting an answer to it. The events detailed above are both high-profile and extraordinary because the U.S. military has publicly confirmed that the images and videos are authentic and were taken by military personnel during sightings and encounters with UFOs. But UFO sightings by both military and members of the public are hardly new. There was a marked spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, with travel limited and more people stuck in their homes, The New York Times reported. However, an uptick in sightings didn't necessarily equate to an increase in objects that were truly unidentified: Only a small fraction of reports scrutinized by NUFORC [National UFO Reporting Center], which is based in Washington State, are truly not identifiable. That proportion has not changed even as more calls have poured in, according to the director. Ufologists are frequently prickly when it comes to the subject of apparent increases in U.F.O. sightings, warning that bumps occur with regularity over the years, and are a favorite subject of news reports. The coverage itself may also drive up so-called sightings, they warn. A recent example of a civilian encounter with such an object that hit the news occurred in February 2021. The flight crew of an American Airlines passenger jet saw an object they couldn't explain over New Mexico. 'We just had something go right over the top of us - I hate to say this but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing - moving really fast, it went right over the top of us,' the pilot said over the radio.Recent Updates Updated with comments given in interviews with Mystery Wire by U.S. senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, chair and vice chair of U.S. Senate Intelligence.

For example, beyond its more banal hangover-cure claims, unproven accounts have existed for decades that during World War II, British and Japanese troops used the liquid, freshly drained from the inside of a coconut, to administer emergency intravenous treatments to their troops. (We contacted the War Studies department at King's College in England seeking comment on those stories, but have yet to hear back.) More recently, a 2002 column published in the Sri Lankan Sunday Observer calling coconut water 'the fluid of life' stated that it could be used as a stand-in for blood plasma 'because it is sterile, pyrogen-free and does not produce heat, and does not destroy blood cells.' Health-related web sites like Body Ecology and Listverse have made similar claims. As the latter blog reported in December 2017: Coconut water can be used (in emergencies) as a substitute for blood plasma.The reason for this is that coconut water (the water found in coconuts - not to be confused with coconut milk, which comes from the flesh of the coconut) is sterile and has an ideal pH level. Coconut water is liquid endosperm - it surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition. The claim also surfaced in a humorous post about 'vegan vampires' circulating online: So I learned from my friend that coconut water can be used as an emergency blood transfusion, and of course my first thought was 'So, can a vampire drink coconut water?' And of course we had this idea of these tropical vampires being horrified when these old world vampires come and are still drinking blood like some sort of monster. Guys oh my god VEGAN VAMPIRES But according to George Yaghmour, a licensed doctor and an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, the consequences of using coconut water as a plasma 'substitute' are not funny at all; he told us: Coconut water and plasma are not equal fluids. Since 1942, there have been several studies confirming that coconut water mimicked intracellular fluids, not the extracellular plasma. While coconut water is a good source for calcium, potassium and magnesium as an oral hydration source, these same elements are concerning when it comes to intravenous use of coconut water, particularly when given in fluid boluses. Hypotonic fluids like coconut water could cause cerebral edema, blood hemolysis, worsening kidney failure, heart arrhythmia and many other neurological complications. There may also be irritation at the injection site. Yaghmour also told us that during 'periods of crisis,' such as major conflicts or epidemics, coconut water may have served as an alternative for medical personnel to buy time for treatment. But 'the acidity, hypotonicity, and high potassium do not make coconut water the ideal resuscitation solution.'

A bill passed by the House this month would use the tax system and federal health care reform to extend restrictions to private insurance coverage. The 'No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,' proposed by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., one of the House's leading abortion opponents, would not allow small businesses to deduct the cost of private employee insurance plans if the plans cover abortion. The tax deductibility of policies is the foundation of employer-provided health insurance. Sen. Sherrod Brown called the bill the 'latest declaration of war on women.' 'Eighty-seven percent of private insurance plans currently include such coverage,' the Ohio Democrat said in a fundraising letter to supporters. If that figure is true, the bill would tightly narrow the range of policy choices or lead insurance plans to drop abortion coverage. We wondered where it came from. Because Brown's statement came in a fundraising message, his office referred us to his sole current campaign worker, Sarah Benzing. She cited stories from the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and other sources using the 87 percent figure, which is attributed to the Guttmacher Institute -- an independent nonprofit whose statistics are used by both sides of the abortion debate. The institute conducted a federally supported study in 2002 with the aim of 'assessing levels of insurance coverage for a wide range of reproductive health services,' and found that 87 percent of typical employer-based insurance policies 'covered medically necessary or appropriate abortions.' A similar study, cited by Guttmacher, was conducted at about the same time by the Kaiser Family Foundation and released as part of its 2003 Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey. It found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortion. The studies asked different questions, helping explain the disparity in results. While Guttmacher reported on policies, Kaiser counts covered workers. Membership in plans would not be evenly distributed. The bottom line, to the institute, is that 'most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion.' So where does Brown's claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? A study by the Kaiser Foundation yielded a much lower figure for coverage, but it is a percentage of covered workers, not plans. Brown's claim specifically cites '87 percent of private insurance plans.' His figure, widely cited in the news media, comes from an organization that both sides of the debate rely one for information. But while the source Brown used is widely cited, it is worth noting that it is not a recent study. The study, attributed to the Guttmacher Institute, was done nearly a decade ago. That's an additional piece of information that helps put the data in context. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim as Mostly True.

The tax deductibility of policies is the foundation of employer-provided health insurance. Sen. Sherrod Brown called the bill the 'latest declaration of war on women.' 'Eighty-seven percent of private insurance plans currently include such coverage,' the Ohio Democrat said in a fundraising letter to supporters. If that figure is true, the bill would tightly narrow the range of policy choices or lead insurance plans to drop abortion coverage. We wondered where it came from. Because Brown's statement came in a fundraising message, his office referred us to his sole current campaign worker, Sarah Benzing. She cited stories from the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and other sources using the 87 percent figure, which is attributed to the Guttmacher Institute -- an independent nonprofit whose statistics are used by both sides of the abortion debate. The institute conducted a federally supported study in 2002 with the aim of 'assessing levels of insurance coverage for a wide range of reproductive health services,' and found that 87 percent of typical employer-based insurance policies 'covered medically necessary or appropriate abortions.' A similar study, cited by Guttmacher, was conducted at about the same time by the Kaiser Family Foundation and released as part of its 2003 Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey. It found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortion. The studies asked different questions, helping explain the disparity in results. While Guttmacher reported on policies, Kaiser counts covered workers. Membership in plans would not be evenly distributed. The bottom line, to the institute, is that 'most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion.' So where does Brown's claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? A study by the Kaiser Foundation yielded a much lower figure for coverage, but it is a percentage of covered workers, not plans. Brown's claim specifically cites '87 percent of private insurance plans.' His figure, widely cited in the news media, comes from an organization that both sides of the debate rely one for information. But while the source Brown used is widely cited, it is worth noting that it is not a recent study. The study, attributed to the Guttmacher Institute, was done nearly a decade ago. That's an additional piece of information that helps put the data in context.

Bernie Sanders Democratic presidential candidate In a Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan Sunday, March 6, 2016 03/06/2016 Read More info","To potential supporters who worry about his viability as a general-election candidate, Bernie Sanders has often pointed to polls showing him doing better against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump than Sanders' Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Sanders repeated this point during the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., on March 6. 'I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I'll tell you why,' Sanders said. 'For a start, ... not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump. ... And, that's true nationally.' We decided to take a closer look at the national polling data and to check with polling experts to see whether head-to-head polls at this stage of the campaign are reliable. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Using the RealClearPolitics.com poll archive, we found seven national surveys since Jan. 1 that tested both Clinton and Sanders against Trump in a general-election contest. Here's the rundown. For each poll, the candidate who runs stronger against Trump is listed in bold. The chart shows that Sanders has a point. Of the seven polls in 2016 that tested both Democratic candidates, Sanders ran stronger against Trump in six of them. (In one case, the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump beat both, but beat Sanders by slightly less.) Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts. Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters' minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.) 'Very few Americans are making these comparisons yet, so opinion about these choices is likely to be weakly held, particularly for a large number of middle-of-the-road, independent, and disinterested Americans who are not participating in primaries and caucuses,' said Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion. Smith added that early polls do not weed out 'likely voters,' as polls later in the campaign do. This could matter, given Sanders' high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting. 'If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons,' Smith said. (He added that the same high level of first-time or irregular voters applies to Trump, but this should be less of a factor for Clinton, whose supporters skew older and more experienced than Sanders' do.) Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, agreed that 'national polls don't have a great deal of predictive value this early in the campaign.' She pointed to research by Harry Enten, a polling analyst at the website fivethirtyeight.com. Enten found that since 1944, general election polls about a year before Election Day 'have only been weakly predictive of the eventual result.' He found that polls pitting the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees were, on average, off by more than 10 points from the eventual result. To cite just one example, Enten wrote that 'if you trusted the polls in late 1991, you might have thought Bill Clinton was finished in the 1992 presidential election. George H.W. Bush was ahead of Clinton by 21 percentage points at the time; Bush was basking in sky-high approval ratings after the first Gulf War. But as the Gulf War triumph faded and the economy became the focus of the campaign, Clinton would gain in the polls and eventually overtake Bush.'",,,,"'Almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump ... and, that's true nationally.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact
16988,4421,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-yellowstone-plan/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In the realm of of science-based clickbait, no topic is more reliable for delivering page views and social media shares than claims that the pool of magma sitting below Yellowstone National Park is about to erupt in a humanity-ending cataclysm. As we have repeatedly, exhaustingly, and redundantly reported, the likelihood of that mega-disaster's occurring in the next couple of thousand years is extremely low, and the region is monitored continuously for threatening activity which would provide ample warning if that situation were to change for some currently unknown reason. A perfect example of the pervasiveness of this claim (and, perhaps, the futility of fact-checking it), comes from the apocalypse-oriented website Breaking Israel News. Over the course of a few sentences, that website strung together multiple previously debunked Yellowstone claims into a meta-claim in need of a fresh debunking: After initially denying that the unusual amount of seismic activity witnessed last year was an indication of imminent danger, NASA scientists are proposing a solution that could save half the world while admitting that their intervention could initiate the explosion it was intended to prevent. Last year, increased seismic activity at Yellowstone generated a great deal of concern. More than 2,300 tremors were recorded between June and September, one of the largest earthquake swarms ever recorded at the site. Though geologists assured the public that the activity was normal for the site, another series of quakes and unusual eruptions beginning in February, increased fears that the supervolcano was waking up. An investigation revealed magma filling up in the underneath chamber of the supervolcano. In July, a massive, 100 ft.-wide fissure opened up in the Grand Teton National Park near Yellowstone, further increasing fears. While Breaking Israel News didn't actually mention a year in their story, the '2,300 tremors recorded between June and September' referred to a series of minor earthquakes breathlessly reported by the Daily Mail and other junk news purveyors back in 2017 as a sign of a coming cataclysm. As we noted in our debunking of those claims, thousands of detectable earthquakes occur in the Yellowstone region in any given year, and they in no way portend an imminent supereruption. The reference to a '100 ft.-wide fissure open[ing] up' in nearby Grand Teton National park, as we reported in July 2018, refers to an unrelated crack in a cliff face which rangers feared could result in a large chunk of rock's crushing climbers and onlookers below, not a coming eruption. This newer iteration of a Yellowstone claim introduced viral fear by asserting that a NASA study published in 2015 (which received attention in a 2017 BBC Futures article) somehow proved NASA was not being honest about geologic events that post-dated their report. That BBC Future article, which Breaking Israel News and other sources cite extensively but without context, presented commentary from an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Brian Wilcox, who served on a NASA Advisory Council on Planetary Defense. That body did conclude in 2015 that a risk of a supervolcano was more likely than a large scale comet or asteroid impact, and they gamed out a variety of extremely theoretical and long-term solutions to mitigate such a risk: Supervolcanic eruptions occur more frequently than large asteroid or comet impacts that would have a similarly catastrophic effect to human civilization, especially now that many asteroid orbits have been mapped. We assess whether future supervolcanic eruptions could be dampened, delayed, or prevented by engineering solutions. That brainstorming did not mean, however, that Wilcox or the other researchers concluded that a supereruption was more likely to occur in our lifetimes than previously thought, or that an urgent need existed to begin geoengineering solutions for it. Via email, Wilcox told us that 'Neither I nor, to my knowledge, any of the co-authors has commented on the seismic activity or possible danger of a near-term eruption.' He referred to the geoengineering plans as a thought experiment revolving around the question 'is it possible for human civilization to prevent supervolcano eruptions that might threaten humanity?' As described by BBC Future, the solution they proposed involved utilizing the heat from the magma for geothermal energy by drilling toward the hot earth and running water through the holes. This would have two benefits, the study argued: First, in the short term, it would provide a possible source of geothermal energy; and second, in the long term, it could (over thousands of years) reduce the overall risk of a caldera-level eruption: They believe the most viable solution could be to drill up to 10km down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure. The circulating water would return at a temperature of around 662F, thus slowly day by day extracting heat from the volcano ... 'Yellowstone currently leaks around 6GW in heat,' Wilcox says. 'Through drilling in this way, it could be used to create a geothermal plant, which generates electric power at extremely competitive prices of around $0.10/kWh. You would have to give the geothermal companies incentives to drill somewhat deeper and use hotter water than they usually would, but you would pay back your initial investment, and get electricity which can power the surrounding area for a period of potentially tens of thousands of years. And the long-term benefit is that you prevent a future supervolcano eruption which would devastate humanity.' When Wilcox said 'long-term,' he was not talking about years or decades. In the study, the team made it clear they were speaking in terms of tens of thousands of years: The cooling perimeter would close-in on the magma chamber at the rate of approx. 1 m/year. Even for a massive supervolcano such as Yellowstone, it would take less than 50,000 years for such a cooling system to completely drain the heat away from the magma chamber, all the while generating electricity at competitive prices. No plans are afoot to begin such a forward-looking initiative, and the report itself stated that any work in that regard right now would be premature. 'There are a number of unknowns about the nature of supervolcanic eruptions and how they are supplied that need to be addressed before attempting any engineered solutions,' the reported concluded. Therefore, no immediate plans to geoengineer a risk-reduction solution to the Yellowstone caldera are at hand, nor is new evidence suggesting an increased risk of eruption. 'The good news is that it does seem possible to achieve [such a risk reduction solution] on a timescale that is short compared to the average time between eruptions of a given supervolcano,' Wilcox told us. 'The bad news is that humans would have to make a concerted effort for thousands of years to defang a volcano like Yellowstone, and it would have essentially no effect if the eruption were going to happen anyway within a few human lifetimes.'",Is NASA Planning to Geoengineer Yellowstone's Supervolcano Threat Away? A theoretical NASA paper written in 2015 was misconstrued in 2018 to suggest an urgent need to geoengineer a solution to Yellowstone's eruptive potential.

There are two statistics that shed some light on this question; one meets Bush's 'millions' threshold at 2.26 million and one does not. But despite some uncertainty over the definitions and the scope of the data, economists told PolitiFact that Bush is on reasonably safe ground in making this claim. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.","During a major policy address intended to increase his profile as a 2016 presidential hopeful, former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush criticized the economic performance of President Barack Obama. 'Six years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer, and millions of people have given up looking for work altogether,' Bush told the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4, 2015. We've already fact checked a similar claim about median incomes being down ( we rated it True), but we wondered whether Bush is correct that 'millions of people have given up looking for work altogether.' When we checked with Bush's staff, they pointed us to two Bureau of Labor Statistics data points -- persons who are 'marginally attached to the labor force' and 'discouraged workers.' These two measurements are similar, but slightly different. 'Marginally attached workers' are those who 'want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months,' but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks prior to being interviewed by federal survey takers. The 'discouraged workers' category is a subset of marginally attached workers, but they have specifically told survey-takers that they aren't looking for work because they're discouraged -- specifically, that they 'believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify.' In December 2014, there were 2.26 million marginally attached workers, of which 740,000 were considered discouraged workers. So if you use the definition for 'marginally attached workers,' then Bush is right that 'millions of people have given up looking for work altogether.' If you use the more specific 'discouraged workers' definition, the number doesn't reach into the 'millions.' We can see an argument for preferring the discouraged workers figures. The four-week period without searching for a job certainly suggests that a person has 'given up' (as Bush put it) but it's not proof positive. The criteria for discouraged workers is somewhat stronger for the purposes of checking Bush's claim, because survey takers have confirmed that workers are indeed 'discouraged.' Still, the definition of marginally attached workers isn't far off from what Bush said, and using that yardstick, the figure is greater than 2 million people, so it qualifies as 'millions.' We asked economists how close Bush was to the mark, and they agreed that he was largely accurate. 'If they want work and are available and have previously looked but haven't looked recently, that sounds to me like they have given up,' said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. University of Chicago economist Robert Shimer agreed. 'No data allows us to answer this with certainty, but the quote seems reasonably likely to be accurate,' he said. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, observed that some young workers might not technically fall under the 'given up' category because the weak labor market since the Great Recession may have convinced them not to begin seeking work at all, perhaps deciding instead to remain in school or become a stay-at-home parent. Still, Burtless said, 'from the perspective of labor-force growth, it amounts to the same thing: A weak job market has kept them from finding work or even looking for work.' Burtless said he's 'fairly confident' that roughly 3 million adults between the ages of 25 and 54 who are currently not working or looking for work would have been in the labor force if they had faced the same labor market conditions that existed in December 2007.",,,,'Millions of people have given up looking for work altogether.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Human intelligence gives us the ability to detect dangers other creatures may not perceive, but it also endows us with emotions that can sometimes overpower our rational judgment. When someone near and dear to us - a spouse, a child, a beloved pet - is threatened, our impulse to act in aid can overcome our instinct for self-preservation and lead us to confront death in ways we would never otherwise conceive. The tale that follows is one example of this phenomenon, concerning a man who died in one of the most gruesome ways imaginable in an attempt to rescue a friend's dog.The hot springs found in abundance throughout Yellowstone National Park's thermal areas are bubbling cauldrons of steam and boiling water, most of them hotter than 150°F, and many of them in the 185°-205°F range. (Due to the elevation, water boils at about 198° in Yellowstone.) Twenty-two scalding deaths have been recorded in connection with Yellowstone's hot springs since 1870, all of them known or believed to have involved people who inadvertently fell into the springs through accident or carelessness - save one.On 20 July 1981, 24-year-old David Allen Kirwan from La Cañada, California, was driving through Yellowstone's Fountain Paint Pot thermal area with his friend Ronald Ratliff and Ratliff's dog Moosie. At about 1:00 P.M. they parked their truck to get out and take a closer look at the hot springs; Moosie escaped from the truck, ran towards nearby Celestine Pool (a thermal spring whose water temperature has been measured at over 200°), jumped in, and began yelping.Kirwan and Ratliff rushed over to the pool to aid the terrified dog, and Kirwan's attitude indicated he was about to go into the spring after it. According to bystanders, several people tried to warn Kirwan off by yelling at him not to jump in, but he shouted 'Like hell I won't!' back at them, took two steps into the pool, and then dove head-first into the boiling spring.Kirwan swam out to the dog and attempted to take it to shore; he then disappeared underwater, let go of the dog, and tried to climb out of the pool. Ratliff helped pull Kirwan out of the hot spring (resulting in second-degree burns to his own feet), and another visitor led Kirwan to the sidewalk as he reportedly muttered, 'That was stupid. How bad am I? That was a stupid thing I did.'Kirwan was indeed in very bad shape. He was blind, and when another park visitor tried to remove one of his shoes, his skin (which was already peeling everywhere) came off with it. He sustained third-degree burns to 100% of his body, including his head, and died the following morning at a Salt Lake City hospital. (Moosie did not survive, either.)Perhaps David Allen Kirwan didn't realize just how hot the thermal springs really are, perhaps he didn't consider the deadly effect submersion in water of such temperatures would have on him, or perhaps blind emotion drove him to act without taking even the briefest moment to consider his own safety. Foolish, brave, rash, or otherwise, can any of us imagine a circumstance, no matter how dire, under which would willingly dive head-first into a pool of boiling water?Updates: Yet another (non-fatal) incident of this type occurred in Yellowstone in 2001 when a 39-year-old tourist from Washington state entered a thermal pool in an attempt to rescue a dog which had bolted from his family's motor home and jumped into the scalding waters. The man was fortunate to have suffered only second-degree burns and was released from the hospital the next day.On 10 October 2014, another man was hospitalized in Reno after he jumped into a hot spring at Black Rock Desert in an effort to save a dog from the scalding waters:Firefighters received a call at about 4 p.m. of a man jumping into the Double Hot Springs at Black Rock Desert, Fire Chief Willard Gooch said. The man was taken to Renown Regional Medical Center via Care Flight, Gooch said. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known. 'There's three (hot springs) that's out there that you can get pretty burned from,' Gooch said. 'There are several out there that people need to pay attention to.' The hot springs at Black Rock Desert can be streams or deep ponds of boiling water, he said. The Double Hot Springs reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks, according to the Friends of Black Rock High Rock. Although the area around the springs is fenced, dogs have been known to jump into or drink from the springs, the Friends of Black Rock said on the organization's website. It [is not yet] known what type of dog jumped in the hot spring, whether the man owned it or if it survived the scalding hot water.While no dog was involved, the June 2016 death of a Portland, Oregon man who wandered off the designated path at Yellowstone National Park and fell into the water near Noris Basin Geyser made headlines because of its gruesome and unusual nature. His sister - who was walking with him at the time and saw him fall in - contacted authorities immediately, but due to the heat and acidity of the water, they were unable to find his remains.Got a tip or a rumor?

The latest testing data show that 40 percent of students failed to meet the minimum math standard and risk being unable to graduate if their skills don't improve. During the March 22 edition of Rhode Island Public Television's 'A Lively Experiment,' state Education Commissioner Deborah Gist defended the requirement. Gist said that if you let students graduate without proficiency you're shortchanging them. 'Anyone who's telling these students that . . . it doesn't matter that they're able to do math at a basic level when they leave high school is just wrong. And it's not fair to them because what's going to happen to them when they leave our high schools and they go to the community college where 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial courses to get the exact same math that we're talking about?' Seventy to seventy-five percent of Rhode Island high school graduates who go to community college have to take remedial courses in math? That struck us as a huge percentage, even for those graduates who wanted a higher education but might not have had the grades, test scores or money to get into a four-year school. So we decided to check the numbers. First stop: Gist's office, where spokesman Elliot Krieger told us that the data came from the Rhode Island Office of Higher Education. When we contacted that office, spokesman Michael Trainor sent us to the Community College of Rhode Island, where William LeBlanc, the school's director of institutional research and planning, gave us the data for students enrolled last fall who had graduated from high school -- 97 percent of them from Rhode Island -- within the previous year. CCRI uses a placement test called Accuplacer, developed by the same group responsible for the Scholastic Assessment Test for college-bound high school students, to identify students who need remedial work. Among those 2,250 recent high school graduates, just over 75 percent needed some type of remedial course, whether it was math, English or writing, LeBlanc said.

This was especially true in 2020, as many internet users felt - with a global pandemic, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, murder hornets, civil unrest, and heightened political tensions - that humanity's luck had simply run out. It's true that an asteroid will approach Earth on the day before the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. However, this is a small asteroid with an even smaller chance of causing any damage to our planet. Asteroid 2018 VP1 is expected to come within 3,000 miles from Earth on Nov. 2, the day before Election Day in the United States. There's a small chance (1 in 240, or 0.41 percent) that the asteroid will make an even more direct approach and that it could even find its way into the planet's atmosphere. However, Asteroid 2018 VP1 is very small. According to NASA, this asteroid is only about 6.5 feet long. If it does head directly toward Earth, this asteroid will burn up in the planet's atmosphere before making impact. Donald Yeomans, a senior researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told The New York Times: 'Close approaches by small objects of this size are not rare, and even if something of this size were to impact, the object would not likely survive the Earth's atmosphere.' NASA's official Twitter account, @asteroidwatch, dedicated to potentially hazardous space objects, posted a message to explain that Asteroid 2018 VP1 does not pose a danger to the planet: While there's a chance that 2018 VP1 will enter the Earth's atmosphere, in all likelihood it will pass by Earth without incident. Space.com writes: This year's flyby will be the asteroid's first close approach to Earth since it was discovered in 2018 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory near San Diego. But while scientists call the event a close approach, the space rock will remain quite far away from Earth: more than 260,000 miles (420,000 kilometers) away. That's about the same distance at which the much larger moon orbits Earth. NASA is constantly monitoring the skies for potentially hazardous objects. Asteroids that pose a serious threat to the planet are classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). Asteroid 2018 VP1 is much smaller (6.5 feet) than the required 500 feet to be classified as a PHA. Here's a description of the PHA requirements from NASA (emphasis ours): Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the asteroid's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth. Specifically, all asteroids with an Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) of 0.05 au or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less are considered PHAs. In other words, asteroids that can't get any closer to the Earth (i.e., MOID) than 0.05 au (roughly 7,480,000 km or 4,650,000 mi) or are smaller than about 140 m (~500 ft) in diameter (i.e., H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 14%) are not considered PHAs. Asteroid 2018 VP1 is cataloged in NASA's Small-Body Database.","Will an Asteroid Hit Earth Right Before Election Day? Not all asteroids are created equal.

Rick Perry bemoaned a failure in Washington to confront Social Security's financial shakiness and praised three Texas counties that quit Social Security nearly 30 years ago. Perry said on CNN's Nov. 4 Parker Spitzer: 'Here's what I think would be a very wise thing. In 1981, Matagorda, Brazoria, and Galveston Counties all opted out of the Social Security program for their employees. Today, their program is very, very well-funded and there is no question about whether it's going to be funded in' years to come. Perry said one option going forward would be to let states decide whether to stay in Social Security or take a different approach to retirement savings. A reader asked us if Perry recapped the Texas experience correctly. Last month, we rated False Perry's statement that Social Security, the federal program that provides old-age and disability payments, is a Ponzi scheme. The program may be fiscally shaky, but it's not a fraudulent criminal enterprise. In Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, Perry prefaces a reference to the Texas counties by saying Americans would fare better if they had the choice of making contributions to a private investment plan rather than Social Security. 'Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits,' Perry writes. A footnote points to an April 2005 article on Galveston County's experiences published by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Policy Analysis. That article, co-authored by Ray Holbrook, a former Galveston County judge, says Galveston's county employees 'sought a secure, risk-free alternative to the Social Security system, and it has worked very well for nearly a quarter-century. Our retirees have prospered, and our working people have had the security of generous disability and accidental death benefits.' According to the article, county employees committed to investing their payroll contributions in fixed-rate guaranteed annuities rather than fluctuating stocks, bonds or mutual funds. The result: Annual rates of return of 6.5 percent averaged over 24 years, the article says, plus substantially better benefits in three Social Security pay-out categories: retirement, survivorship and disability. 'To be sure, our plan wasn't perfect, and we have made some adjustments,' the article says. 'For instance, a few of our retired county workers are critical of the plan today because they say they are making less money than they would have on Social Security. This is because our plan allowed workers to make 'hardship' withdrawals from the retirement plan during their working years. Some workers withdrew funds for current financial problems and consequently robbed their own future benefits. We closed that option (in January 2005).' We learned from Rick Gornto, the certified financial planner who helped start and still oversees the alternate plans, that plan participants can take their accumulated earnings in a lump sum or in regular installments once they retire. 'They do have an opportunity to take it out and squander it,' Gornto said, adding that the lump-sum option might be eliminated in the future. Gornto said the reason that hasn't happened yet is that the annuities began as a supplement to county employees' primary retirement program -- fixed payments through pension plans managed by the Texas County and District Retirement System, which is based in Austin. Perry didn't mention this plan in his book or on CNN. Gornto said the safety net of the county and district retirement plan made it possible to design the alternate plan with its lump-sum feature. If the other pension plan wasn't in place, Gornto said, he probably would have proposed a plan without a lump-sum feature and offering regular post-retirement payments along with the leeway to invest earnings. The 2005 article mentions 1999 reviews of the Galveston plan by the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Social Security Administration. We turned to them next. Among points the agencies raised: +Low-paid workers stood to get less in monthly retirement payments under the alternate plan than they would under Social Security. In response, the 2005 article says the studies assumed a low 4 percent return on the plans' annuities; actual returns have been substantially higher. +Workers with higher earnings and fewer or no dependents who qualify for Social Security generally fare better under the Galveston plan, particularly in the near term, but workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security, the report says. +Galveston's retirement funds are invested at the county's discretion and employees do not control investment decisions. During 1981-97, annual interest earned on the plan's fixed annuity contracts averaged an inflation-adjusted 4.62 percent. During the period, annual interest earned on Social Security's investments averaged 4.88 percent, the administration report says. On the plus side, the GAO review notes: 'The alternate plans' benefits are fully funded, while Social Security's promised benefits cannot be met without increasing program revenues.' Finally, we chased up-to-date information per the Texas plans' health. The county treasurers for Brazoria and Matagorda counties, Amy Perez and Sharon Reynolds, respectively, told us their plans work well. Like a Galveston County official, Perez and Reynolds suggested we gather particulars from Gornto. Gornto said in an interview that a key to the alternate plans' appeal is their guaranteed annual return, now at least 3.75 percent. He added that unlike Social Security, which needs changes to remain financially viable in the long term, the counties' plans don't confront a money-gone date: 'We don't have an 'out-year' question issue because people put their money in, they match it, and whatever it grows to is what they get.' He said up-front contributions to the plans will remain stable so long as the counties don't go broke, while pay-outs to beneficiaries are certain unless the United States completely devalues its currency. 'The money will be there,' Gornto said. Gornto forwarded a summary of his firm's review of the Galveston County plan for October 2008 through September 2009. In an interview, he noted that by the end of that year, the plan had $54.1 million available to be paid employees in deferred (or retirement) compensation. Employees and the county combined pitched in about $6 million in payroll contributions through the year. 'The county has adopted this program to replace Social Security,' Gornto said. 'Until they make a decision to disband the plan, it will always be there.' For outside expertise, we talked to Keith Brainard, who's the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. After reviewing the materials Gornto shared with us, Brainard explained that the alternate plan is a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401k plan, in which benefits are determined solely based on contributions and investment earnings. 'By definition, the plan is always fully funded because the plan pays out only as much as it collects,' Brainard said in an e-mail. That said, Brainard wrote, the plan lacks three features that are part of Social Security: a minimum benefit for lower-income workers; protection from inflation; and required annuitization, meaning that participants must receive at least some of their benefit as a lifetime income stream, rather than as a single lump-sum. On the other hand, he said, the long-term cost of the Texas plan is clear and certain. Also, unlike Social Security, plan participants own their retirement assets, rather than being entitled only to a monthly benefit for the remainder of their lives. The basic difference between the Texas plan and Social Security, Brainard said, is that the Texas plan is a 'retirement savings plan that provides benefits based on contributions and investment performance, while Social Security is an insurance plan intended chiefly to prevent stark poverty in old age. Social Security promises a certain level of benefits based on salary and other factors, with a minimum benefit for lower-income workers and a maximum for higher-income workers. Both plans present relative advantages and disadvantages, and an argument could be made for providing elements of both plan types for all working Americans.' And how does Perry's statement fare? Far as we can tell, the alternate plans are healthy and should remain so. But the Texas plans serve employees also eligible, depending on years of service, for the Austin-based pension plan. Perry's larger point, that Americans stand to benefit from swapping out Social Security for alternate plans, doesn't acknowledge this pre-existing safety net in the Texas counties.

Trump, a Republican, retweeted the video and added the comment, 'Thank you Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!' Thank you Cowboys. See you in New Mexico! https://t.co/aCRJeskUA8 - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2020 Griffin's comments were originally made on May 17, 2020, during an event in Truth or Consequences, a city in New Mexico.

The retweet by Trump drew criticism that Trump and Griffin were promoting violence against legislators who are members of the opposing political party. Griffin's comments, in their entirety and as heard in the video tweeted by Trump, are: I've come to a place where I've come to the conclusion that the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat. I don't say that in the physical sense and I can already see the videos getting edited where it says I wanna go murder Democrats. No, I say that in the political sense because the Democrat agenda and policy is anti-American right now.

Cowboys for Trump is marketed as a for-profit organization in New Mexico that accepts donations from the public. The tweet that Trump retweeted was originally posted by the organization to refute a Daily Beast article that reported Griffin had called for Democratic politicians to die. In spite of Cowboys for Trump labeling the Daily Beast article titled 'Anti-Lockdown Protesters Now Calling for Dems to Die' as fake news, Griffin is quoted in that article saying that certain Democratic governors should be executed for what he views as treason, stating, 'You get to pick your poison: you either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope.' When asked whether protesters angry over stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 were considering using violence, Griffin said in the article, 'I'll tell you what, partner, as far as I'm concerned, there's not an option that's not on the table.'

It's been a trend that a few of the candidates for president have reflected in their campaigns. Tvert got it right. The statement is True.,"Gallup pollsters took the nation's pulse on marijuana legalization in October and the findings led supporters of legal pot use to declare victory. 'It's pretty clear which direction our nation is heading on this issue,' Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a news release. 'The status quo has shifted. Marijuana prohibition has been a public policy disaster, and most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on.' We started our fact checking with Gallup's recent report to see if it really does show that a majority of Americans support legalization. Just the title of the report - 'In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use' - gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. Just the title of the report - 'In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use' - gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. 'Americans' support for legalizing marijuana is the highest Gallup has measured to date, at 58 percent,' the report concludes. 'Younger generations of Americans,' Gallup says, 'have been increasingly likely to favor legal use of marijuana as they entered adulthood compared with older generations of Americans when they were the same age decades ago. Now more than seven in 10 of today's young adults support legalization.' The 58 percent figure represents the percentage of 1,015 people who answered 'Yes,' when they were asked, 'Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?' The percent of Americans who support legalization first hit 58 percent in 2013, dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and rebounded back to 58 percent in 2015, according to Gallup. 'Over the past six years, support has vacillated a bit, but averaged 48 percent from 2010 through 2012 and has averaged above majority level, 56 percent, since 2013,' says the report. The poll was conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, just before leading Democrats faced off in a presidential nomination debate televised by CNN on Oct. 13. During that exchange, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed their views on marijuana legalization. Clinton laughed, at the debate, when she was reminded that about a year ago she had told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that she didn't smoke marijuana when she was young and has no intention of starting now. Clinton said 'No' when she was asked if she is ready 'to take a position' on legalization. But she said she's interested in learning more about legalization from states that have approved recreational marijuana use. For his part, Sanders said he would vote for a local Nevada measure that would legalize recreational pot use. He has proposed removing marijuana from the federal government's list of most dangerous outlawed drugs, according to the Washington Post. The same Gallup report says Democrats and independents are the 'most likely' of 'political groups' to favor legalization while Republicans and older Americans are least likely to support it. Late last week, Republican Donald Trump, speaking at a rally, said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana if they choose to do so, according to the Post. This was a softer stance on the subject for Trump, who says he doesn't drink or smoke tobacco. Two of the other leading Republican candidates are holding the line. Republican, Marco Rubio would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana use. And Republican Ben Carson, who is leading in the polls, is a retired neurosurgeon who staunchly opposes legalization. Many studies, he says, show marijuana has a harmful effect on a brain as it develops, which continues into a person's late twenties. 'So why would we even think about it?' he asked.

7968,11064,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fluoroquinolone-antibiotics-tendon-damage/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 18 March 2017, the author of a blog called 'Mountains and Mustard Seeds' published a post about her personal experience with serious medical complications caused by a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. These drugs include: Avelox (moxifloxacin) Cipro and Cipro extended-release (ciprofloxacin) Factive (gemifloxacin) Levaquin (levofloxacin) Ofloxacin (a generic brand) That post (headlined 'This Antibiotic Will Ruin You') highlights somewhat recent announcements made by the FDA requiring new warning labels and suggested limitations on their use: The antibiotics you took or are taking for your sinus infection, UTI, skin infection, laser eye surgery...ect [sic]...may have already damaged you. Cipro, Levaquin, Avalox, nearly every generic ending in 'quin', 'oxacin,''ox,'...are all part of a large family of antibiotics called 'Fluoroquinolones.' The FDA finally updated their warning on these antibiotics as of July 2016. They cite 'multiple system damage that may be irreversible.' Permanent you guys. [...] In 2010, I took Cipro for a UTI and it changed my life forever. A round of antibiotics literally changed the path I was walking, into a path that I couldn't even crawl on. Multiple spontaneous tendon and ligament ruptures, spinal degeneration, and arthritis that is widespread. We are talking multiple joint dislocations and surgeries to most of my large joints and spine. Twenty surgeries in the last 7 years if you wanna count. While our post does not seek to verify the author's personal story, the information presented regarding documented complications from this class of antibiotics is factual. The Food and Drug Administration, since July 2008, has issued a series of increasingly strong notices regarding the rare (but serious) risk of tendon rupture, tendonitis, and neurologic damage resulting in pain or numbness. These alerts culminated in a revised 'Boxed Warning' and new prescribing recommendations, as described in a 26 July 2016 FDA safety announcement: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved changes to the labels of fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs for systemic use (i.e., taken by mouth or by injection). These medicines are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system that can occur together in the same patient. As a result, we revised the Boxed Warning, FDA's strongest warning, to address these serious safety issues. We also added a new warning and updated other parts of the drug label, including the patient Medication Guide. As a 2015 review of adverse effects from fluoroquinolone antibiotics explained, the class of drugs has a long history of use for a broad range of conditions, and uses a unique mechanism that actively destroys bacterial DNA: Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. Since then, FQs have been used extensively to treat a wide range of infections and, although not approved by the FDA for prevention, are also increasingly used as prophylaxis against infection among persons with cancer and other immune compromised states. That same report, which used data collected by the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to demonstrate the reality of these risks, stated that while the exact mechanism by which fluoroquinolones may contribute to tendon damage is unclear, it does likely involve mitochondrial damage as described in the Mountains and Mustard Seed post: The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. [...] FQs cause oxidative stress in tenocyte cells through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This overproduction has direct toxic effects in the extracellular matrix. In addition, FQs cause mitochondrial toxicity and apoptosis. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. To be clear, the risks are still somewhat rare. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. Because of the potentially permanent and disabling effect of these risks, the FDA argues, the risk-to-benefit ratio has shifted enough to merit limiting their prescription to cases of absolute necessity, per their July 2016 notice: We have determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients who have no other treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, (ABS), acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), and uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits in these patients. For some serious bacterial infections the benefits of fluoroquinolones outweigh the risks, and it is appropriate for them to remain available as a therapeutic option. The author of the 'Mountains and Mustard Seeds' post also alluded to potential psychiatric complications: Fluoroquinolones cross the blood brain barrier. This can result in psychiatric events, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I was incredibly fortunate not to have the psychiatric side of this. This, too, is accurate, although the recent changes to FDA warnings were not spurred by any new incidents or developments regarding mental health events. A 2003 study using data collected by the Italian government estimated that psychiatric effects from fluoroquinolones occur in about 1.8 percent of cases, with a majority of those cases being minor and self-resolving. Ultimately, any drug comes with potential adverse effects and discussing those risks versus the potential benefits with a doctor is wise. In the case of fluoroquinolones, there are indeed serious risks that need to be considered, especially when other classes of antibiotics may be effective.","Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? Though still rare, the potential risks are significant enough for the Food and Drug Administration to suggest limiting these drugs' use to cases of absolute necessity.

Is Sanders correct? Or was this political grandstanding? Berkeley, Calif., remains the lone American city to enact a sugary drink tax. It taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1 cent per ounce. Studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers. A Cornell study found about 25 percent of it was passed on, and a University of California-Berkeley study found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent, depending on the type of beverage. The prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores. Carl Davis, the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told Billy Penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by Philadelphia are 'imperfect:' 'The first thing you realize is that it is regressive. It's going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher-income families.' William Shughart, a Utah State University professor and sin tax expert, explained taxes like the one proposed by Kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks. Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor for Sanders, said in an email, 'It would make much more sense to finance universal pre-school in Philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents, who currently benefit from flat state and city tax rates. Right now wealthy Philadelphians pay state income tax of 3.07 percent, an unemployment tax of 0.07 percent, and a city income tax of 3.92 percent. That's a total state and local tax burden of 7.06 percent. By contrast, New York City's wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12.6 percent.' Such a plan would be easier said than done, according to Kenney's administration. 'Because of the uniformity clause, it's constitutionally impermissible right now in Pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals,' said Lauren Hitt, Kenney's communications director. 'The Republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and we're not holding our breath on that one. Our kids need Pre-K now.' Kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods. His finance director, Rob Dubow, said most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods. When Dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax, City Council president Darrell Clarke responded, 'Fundamentally, I don't believe that.'",,,,'A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia.,supported,true,,politifact

Trump said the Democrats were sharing a photo of detained children from 2014 during President Barack Obama's presidency. 'Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama's term showing children from the Border in steel cages,' Trump tweeted May 29. 'They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!' Trump's tweets followed some blame and confusion about nearly 1,500 'lost' immigrant children. In late April, a federal agency reported being unable to locate about 1,500 children who came to the United States alone. Around the same time, the Trump administration announced a 'zero-tolerance' policy to ramp up prosecutions of individuals who cross the border illegally. Trump's tweet is accurate. One of the Democrats who shared the photo was Jon Favreau, a former Obama speechwriter. Favreau, who has one million followers on Twitter, tweeted on May 27: 'Look at these pictures. This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.' Favreau included a link to a Arizona Republic story showing a photo of two detainees lying on mats on the ground in a holding cell with the headline 'First Glimpse of Immigrant Children at holding facility.' While Favreau has since deleted the tweet, Twitchy and Fox News showed screen grabs. The photo was taken by Ross D. Franklin of the Associated Press in June 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection Agency center in Nogales, Arizona. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article which described the migrants as 'children in cages.' The newspaper verified the timing of the photo in a tweet. Minutes after Favreau's tweet about the photo, at 3:27 p.m. Favreau followed up with a tweet that cited the actual date of the photo. 'These awful pictures are from 2014, when the government's challenge was reconnecting unaccompanied minors who showed up at the border with family or a safe sponsor. Today, in 2018, the government is CREATING unaccompanied minors by tearing them away from family at the border.' Favreau responded to our questions by pointing to his May 29 Twitter thread, including this tweet: 'I tweeted a story that multiple journalists were posting. My mistake for not checking the date first. A few minutes later, when I realized my error, I deleted the tweet and immediately tweeted the correct info and date of the picture.' In an email, Favreau told PolitiFact that a New York Times Magazine editor was one of the journalists who posted the photo. Jake Silverstein, the magazine's editor in chief, tweeted on May 27 'My bad for RT'ing without closer inspection and implying by timing that it's current.'

14010,1050,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-rosie-insanity-campaign-donations/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In May 2018, right-wing blogs pounced on a New York Post story concerning alleged campaign contribution violations by actress and comedian Rosie O'Donnell. According to the Post, the former co-host of The View exceeded the $2,700 limit on individual campaign contributions in donations to several Democratic Party candidates via the fundraising web site ActBlue, while using five different New York addresses and four variations of her name. The report also said that O'Donnell donated $90,000 to 50 different committees and candidates for federal office. O'Donnell reportedly told the Post via email that she did 'nothing nefarious,' adding that she did not choose to donate over the limit. The newspaper also quoted her as saying: My anxiety is quelled by donating to those opposing trump [and] his agenda - especially at night - when most of these were placed. Conservative bloggers seized on that remark to accuse O'Donnell of 'pleading insanity': Trump-hating liberal Rosie O'Donnell has accused President Trump of many bogus crimes. She has been obsessed with trying to accuse President Trump of nonsense. She has became completely obsessed with President Trump. Her Twitter feed is filled with incohrrent [sic] rants. Now the Trump curse continues as she is pleading insanity in hopes of not paying the penalty for breaking campaign finance laws. She is facing criminal charges thanks to a campaign finance scheme. In fact, there has been no announcement of an investigation into the alleged donations, let alone 'criminal charges.' The Federal Election Commission did not comment on the Post's report. While the Post's report has been aggregated by blogs and other news outlets, no second source has emerged corroborating its findings. An ActBlue spokesperson, Chris Fleming, did not comment on the story, but did tell us: ActBlue does not allow over the limit contributions in any one transaction, and ActBlue offers donors the option of saving all their info in an account where they can track their cumulative giving through ActBlue and compare/add to offline giving. While the Post reported that FEC violations only rarely lead to penalties, Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson said that it can depend on the jurisdiction. 'For instance, some cities and states are much more aggressive about finding and fining people for these violations than others,' said Levinson, who focuses on campaign finance in her work: On the federal level, it is true that the Federal Election Commission is a model of inaction. I think it would be fair to say that fines are not common, but I'm not really convinced that these types of violations are terrifically common. For her part, O'Donnell accused the Post on Twitter of employing 'sinister ways to warp the truth.' She also posted a photograph depicting her contributions on the ActBlue platform, listed at 66 donations totaling $75,500: She told the Post that candidates should refund donation money that exceeds the individual limit, adding, 'I don't look to see who I can donate most to.... I just donate assuming they do not accept what is over the limit.' FEC regulations state that campaign committees that receive individual donations over the $2,700 limit have 60 days to refund the excess amount, redesignate it toward another election, or reattribute the money to someone else. In the event of a redesignation or reattribution, the contributor must be notified of the committee's intent and offered the chance to collect a refund instead. The newspaper's report centered on contributions from O'Donnell to two current Democratic congressional candidates - Lauren Underwood in Illinois and Omar Vaid in New York - as well as campaigns for three current lawmakers from the same party: Rep. Adam Schiff from California; Doug Jones of Alabama; and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania. Lamb's campaign will reportedly contact O'Donnell and offer to either refund or redesignate her excess contributions; Vaid's told the Post that it would amend its filings. A spokesperson for Underwood told us: Because of the data point differences in name, address, and employer, our systems did not flag these contributions as totaling above the limit. In the coming weeks, we will be amending our report. Bloggers also attempted to compare O'Donnell's purported violations to the outright illegal donations that led to the 2014 conviction of right-wing documentarian Dinesh D'Souza. D'Souza was sentenced to five years probation and eight months in a halfway house after pleading guilty to making illegal contributions in the names of others. D'Souza asked two friends and their partners to donate $10,000 apiece in 2012 toward Republican Wendy Long's senatorial candidate. 'I do think we could find a distinction between what D'Souza was charged with - making a contribution of about 10 times the legal limit - with what O'Donnell is accused of - making a total of $5,400 in contributions over the legal limit to five different candidates,' Levinson said. 'O'Donnell's error seems more believably to be one of ignorance, while it is hard to believe that D'Souza believed a $20,000 contribution was legal.'",Did Rosie O'Donnell 'Plead Insanity' Over Illegal Campaign Donations?

Tanden accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Tanden said and depend on how you define income. Tanden's statement is accurate but in need of clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","With most political handicappers giving Republicans the edge in the 2014 midterm elections, the pundits get to debate whether Democrats can rally their base and beat the odds. A primary question is whether the country's struggle with income inequality offers the Democratic party the toe hold with voters that it needs. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's new book A Fighting Chance gave the panelists on NBC's Meet the Press an opening to bat this about. Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning group, argued that the issue not only would work well among the party faithful but beyond. '95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent, That's a fact in the country,' Tanden said. 'I think this is going to be an issue on both the right and the left.' The claim that the top earners have done extremely well coming out of the Great Recession has come up before. While there is some debate over the details, in large measure, Tanden is on solid ground. The statement goes back to a study from University of California-Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez. In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent. 'Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery,' Saez wrote. The main caveat with Saez's work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn't include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc.) or the value of health insurance benefits. Saez focused on employment wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. So Tanden has her numbers right by Saez's figuring, but what you count as income makes a difference. We'll now walk you through some other ways of looking at this question. Other interpretations, analysis We came across a study that measured income differently than Saez -- by measuring capital gains regardless of whether the owner cashed out and including government assistance programs. That study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found a wide income disparity as well, but noted that the gap actually narrowed between 1989 and 2007. There's another argument that it makes more sense to calculate consumption rather than income. Economist Aparna Marthur with the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think-tank in Washington, believes what people spend shows you how well people are actually living, and it doesn't matter if they pay for it using credit cards, their weekly paycheck or their savings. Viewed this way, the situation is not as bad. 'We find that consumption inequality is much narrower than income inequality,' Marthur said. 'And has shown no trend towards widening over the last few decades.' Marthur's perspective is fuel for a policy debate that goes far beyond what we are writing about here, but there is one other criticism of Saez's analysis. Eugene Steurele, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a D.C-based academic center, warned about using 2009, the very bottom of the recession, as the starting point. 'The economic cycle messes up this comparison,' Steurele told PunditFact in January. 'In recovering from a recession, if an unemployed person stays with the same unemployment benefits, and a wage earner doesn't increase her wages, but the stock market recovers enough so there are more capital gains, then one might get these types of results.' Steurele said Saez's findings are useful but his approach simplifies a complex situation. Work by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy analysis arm of Congress, goes at least part way toward addressing Steurele's concern. A 2011 report chose two points at the same place in the economic cycle, 1996 and 2006. It also factored in taxes and if its results are not exactly comparable to the Saez article, they point in the same direction. 'The poorest tax filers (the bottom fifth) saw average after-tax income fall by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006,' the report said. While 'the richest 1 percent of tax filers experienced a 74 percent increase in after-tax income.' The main reason for the widening gap was the rapid growth in capital gains and dividends income among the wealthy, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The latest annual review of data by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality found that 'after the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, income and consumption inequality increased.' The report noted that households in the bottom fifth of the income ladder received 3.4 percent of all income in 2012. However, going back to the pundits' debate over how this will play out in the voting booth, one statistic might give the Democrats some concern. The Pew Research Center, an independent study group, found that Americans are not too worried about income inequality. In the center's 2013 survey of global attitudes, barely half of Americans said the rich-poor gap is a very big problem.",,,,'95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The latest comparable figures, from 2013, support his claim. We rate it True.","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders starts with the nation's richest family when describing the magnitude of wealth inequality in the United States. 'Today in America one family, the Walton family of Walmart. You all heard of Walmart. This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people,' Sanders, I-Vt., said recently in Norfolk during a rally for his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims in the past from Sanders and other liberals, but the last time was in 2013. Since the statement has become a standard line in Sanders' campaign speech, we decided to give it a new examination. The claim originates from research by Sylvia Allegretto, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California-Berkeley. She last updated her research in 2014. Allegretto tallied the total wealth held by the six relatives of Walmart founder Sam Walton: his sons Jim and Robert Walton; daughter Alice Walton; daughter-in-law Christy Walton; and his nieces, Ann Walton Kroenke and Nancy Walton Laurie. Using figures from the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans in 2013, Allegretto totaled the wealth of those six Waltons at $145 billion. Next, she turned to a survey of the net worth of Americans published every three years by the Federal Reserve. The most recent one was published in 2014 based on survey results from the previous year. The combined worth of the Walton clan in 2013, Allegretto said, 'equaled the total wealth of the entire bottom 43 percent.' We should point out that this is not a measure of 'income' - the amount of money families earn every year. Instead, wealth is the bottom-line figure of a household's 'net worth.' As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin pointed out in their 2013 fact-check, net worth is the amount left over after accounting for things such as savings and retirement accounts minus what's owed on home mortgages, credit card bills and other debts. That means it's entirely possible for someone earning a six-digit salary to be in the 'bottom 40 percent,' because all their debts still could leave them with zero or even negative net worth. Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute free-market think tank in London, has been critical of comparing the Walton wealth to people of modest net worth. Worstall noted in a 2011 op-ed in Forbes that many high earners easily could fall into the category of zero or negative net worth, such as doctors still paying off loans from attending medical school. 'If you've no debts and have $10 in your pocket, you have more wealth than 25% of Americans. More than that 25% of Americans have collectively that is,' Worstall wrote. Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington think tank, looked at the figure another way in a 2014 post. Noting that the Federal Reserve placed the median U.S. family wealth the previous year at $81,200, he wrote that it would take 1.7 million families with that amount of net worth to equal the wealth of the Waltons, he said. The Walton wealth has not been static since 2013. Forbes this year published figures showing the family's wealth has declined to $121.9 billion -- a drop of $23.1 billion. Forbes explained it lowered the net worth held by Christy Walton after new information surfaced showing that her late husband, John - Sam Walton's son - left some of his fortune to charity. We wondered whether that reduced $121.9 billion figure still would leave the Waltons' wealth equal to about 40 percent of U.S. families. Allegretto was unavailable to run a new set computations for us. So we turned to the Urban Institute, a Washington non-profit specializing in economic social research. Its numbers show that Sanders' claim remains correct based on the latest national wealth figures from 2013.",,,,'The Walton family of Walmart ...

Pants on Fire!","Social media users are claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted she used smear tactics to demonize political opponents. According to these users, a YouTube video even shows her saying so in her very own words. The video, an excerpt from a June 22, 2017, press briefing, began circulating in 2018 after allegations of sexual assault dominated Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing.

More recent posts have claimed that the clip shows Pelosi describing the tactics Democrats used to attack former President Donald Trump. Here's why you shouldn't believe these claims: The video takes Pelosi out of context and misleadingly captions her remarks, making it seem like she's explaining a political tactic called the 'wrap-up smear' that she and other Democrats have deployed in the past.

The video was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That's because the clip cuts out both the question that Pelosi was responding to and the first part of her remarks. A longer version of the video shows that Pelosi was accusing Republicans of using the 'wrap-up smear' against Democrats running for office in the 2018 midterms. She was not laying out a blueprint of how to smear Republican opponents. Here's a transcript of the relevant passage from Pelosi's press briefing, complete with the question she was answering when she made her 'wrap-up smear' comment. Reporter: 'Is it worth it to try and I guess like rehab your image in some of these Republican districts, which would sort of present what you've done, or are you guys more focused on just-' Pelosi: 'Well, people say to me all the time, 'you raise more money than anybody,' maybe not the Obamas and the Clintons, but I've not run for president. 'Why don't you spend some of your money on yourself? Go out there and say what you did, this, this and this.' But you know, it's just not... Maybe I should, but the fact is, what I want to do is have these members present themselves. Because basically at the end of the day that's what people are interested in - their representative and what their representative is going to do for their district. Republicans are afraid of that contrast in a race. Because they're going to go there to be involved in trickle-down economics, shutting down hospitals, and the rest of it. So they don't want them to see that contrast, so they focus on something else. And it's a diversionary tactic. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Obama obtained that figure from an August report from Greentech Media. Solar has been expanding, but it remains a small slice of the overall market. We rate this claim True.","President Barack Obama touted his energy strategy during his State of the Union speech. He called for safe extraction of natural gas, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and setting new standards for trucks -- and he shined a spotlight on solar power. 'It's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming; we're becoming a global leader in solar, too,' Obama said. 'Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can't be outsourced.' That timetable sounded like a rapid expansion of solar: Does a home or business go solar every four minutes? We'll shed a little light on this claim. Solar expansion Obama's claim came from Greentech Media (GTM), which published the statistic in August in its Solar Market Research Report, a project with the Solar Energy Industries Association. GTM provides quarterly and annual reports that contain solar-specific analysis and forecasts for industry professionals. A GTM chart shows how solar installations have rapidly increased in recent years from one every 80 minutes in 2006 to one every four minutes in 2013. 'A lot happens in America every four minutes,' wrote GTM in an August blog about their research. 'During that short time period, 30 babies are born, 4,080 McDonald's Big Macs are consumed, and 48,000 tons of CO2 are emitted. And as it turns out, the U.S. is now installing one solar photovoltaic (PV) system every four minutes as well. If market growth continues at its current pace, the American solar industry could be installing a system every minute and twenty seconds by 2016.' Every quarter GTM collects the number of solar installations from utilities and state agencies. Researchers get data from 28 states (including Florida ) which represents about 97 percent of the market and devise an estimate for the remaining states, said Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research. GTM has been tracking the solar market since 2009 and collected this particular detailed data since 2010. (Kann said that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has some data on solar installations but not to the level of detail that GTM requires for quarterly reports.) In 2013, there were about 132,000 installations, and there were 525,600 minutes, so the math works out to about one installation every four minutes. GTM is finalizing the number of installations in 2013 -- GTM says it's possible it could have been higher. Part of the reason for the rapid growth is that the cost of solar panels and installation has dropped, Kann said. Experts on alternative energy generally agreed with GTM's research but offered some caveats. 'Solar is growing, but from a very small number...,' said Christopher Bronk, director of the Program on Energy and Cybersecurity at Rice University. According to the November electric power monthly report from the Energy Information Administration, 'PV solar energy accounts for about 1.5 percent of all electricity generated from renewable sources and .2 percent percent of all the electricity generated.' And not surprisingly, solar is more common in some states than others. 'As you move to places with a lot more cloud cover, let's say Washington, D.C., then solar energy isn't going to work as well,' said Stephen P.A. Brown, an expert in energy economics at the University of Nevada. 'Unless there is some huge change in technology it's not projected to be the dominant form of energy any time soon or in fact ever.'",,,,"'Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar.",supported,true,,politifact

The record bears this out. Lincoln tried in Delaware and won congressional approval to apply the principle to all states. But with no slave owners willing to come to the table, the effort failed. The result was the Emancipation Proclamation. We rate the claim True.","Buying slaves to set them free is a much better fit with libertarian thinking than the use of force. That's why in his recent debate with The Daily Show's Jon Stewart, libertarian pundit Andrew Napolitano argued that Lincoln 'could have bought the slaves.' 'Buying the slaves' freedom is not as true as you might believe,' Stewart rebutted. 'He offered them money for their slaves, in the border states -- those are the ones that hadn't even seceded yet -- and they refused.' We're checking several claims from the debate between Napolitano and Stewart. Here, we're looking at Stewart's claim that Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves freedom in border states, but the states 'all rejected it.' We asked Columbia University historian Eric Foner. 'During the first two years of the war Lincoln repeatedly offered 'compensated emancipation' to the border slave states that remained in the Union and any Confederate states interested,' Foner said. 'But they all rejected it. Lincoln was willing to pay but Southerners were not willing to give up their slaves, for money or for any other reason.' We enlisted the help of historians, and history buffs on reddit, and they pointed us to Lincoln's request to Congress in 1862 for money to buy the freedom of slaves. Here's how that proposal began: 'Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences public and private, produced by such change of system.' Republicans passed that over the objection of Democrats. Richard Striner, professor of history at Washington College, wrote that this resolution was Lincoln's second attempt to pay slave owners to free their slaves. A year earlier, he had tried to get Delaware to pass a bill that would have cleared the way for Washington to spend $719,200 to free the state's entire slave population, about 1,800 at that time. The bill failed in the Delaware Legislature. In one odd case, Lincoln personally offered to buy a slave from an owner in Kentucky. Kentucky was on the Union side but was unwilling to emancipate the slaves that lived there. In late 1862, when an escaped slave found refuge with a Union army regiment, and the Kentucky owner demanded his return, Lincoln wrote to the owner, 'I will pay you any sum not to exceed $500.' Unusual circumstances surrounded this move by the president. The owner was a former member of Congress and former Kentucky Supreme Court justice. Lincoln had issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation two months earlier and wanted to head off a dispute in Kentucky. As it turned out, the owner refused Lincoln's offer. The slave was not returned.",,,,"Says Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves' freedom in border states, but the states 'all rejected it.",supported,true,,politifact

Experts say studies clearly support Obama's point. We rate Obama's statement True. Editor's note: This item was edited after initial publication to clarify that researchers studied the word gap of children up to age 3, not age 5.","Words, words, words. President Barack Obama is certainly fond of them. His recent speech on economic issues, in which he backed a minimum wage increase, included more than 6,500. But what about a point Obama made in the speech about how the income gap affects young children? 'By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she's already behind,' he said. Just for comparison's sake, 30 million words would be equivalent to 4,615 Obama speeches. But did he get his fact right? We'd never heard of this finding before, so we took a closer look. When we asked the White House for a source, a spokesman pointed us to research from the mid 1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley. They published their findings in a book, Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children. Over several years, the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses, based on education and income levels, and found that better-off families engaged their children more frequently with language. They found a 30 million 'word gap' by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes. That's one piece of evidence, they argued, to explain the 'achievement gap,' a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower-income students start kindergarten on worse footing. The word gap, along with other issues, leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls, said Dana Suskind, a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago. She's also the director of Thirty Million Words Initiative, one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research. 'This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life,' Suskind said. Obama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development, said Samuel Odom, a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. When asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question, Suskind told us it's 'pretty well-accepted' as the norm in the field. In addition, she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately. Suskind offered just one caveat: While Obama described the norm, there's variation from family to family. Some low-income families speak to and interact with their kids more, and some more affluent families don't. 'No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed,' she said.

This fact check is available at IFCN's 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.","In one of the two Georgia runoffs that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate, GOP incumbent David Perdue used the S word - socialism - to brand his opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue's attack came in an interview on a TV show hosted by Mike Huckabee, the Republican former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate. 'Philosophically, where do you and (Ossoff) differ significantly? What's the main difference between you?' Huckabee asked. 'Well, it's very simple,' Perdue replied. 'He's a socialist.' Perdue has used the term repeatedly about Ossoff, although more often he refers to what he claims is the documentary filmmaker's support of a socialist agenda. President Donald Trump labeled Joe Biden a socialist - a claim we rated False, but one that some believe helped Trump win Florida in the Nov. 3 election. Much of the evidence Perdue cites about Ossoff's policy positions is inaccurate. And even if what he cited were correct, it doesn't amount to Ossoff being a socialist. What is socialism? Socialism has support among a significant number of Americans, particularly those who see it as promoting equality and more social services. A September 2020 Hill-HarrisX poll found that slightly more Democratic voters view socialism more favorably than capitalism. Strictly speaking, however, the most narrow definition of socialism refers to 'governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.' Ossoff has not stated support for such government control. When Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speak of socialism, they are referring to expanding the social programs already available, along with potentially higher tax rates to pay for them. But Ossoff opposes Sanders' Medicare for All and Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal. RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs Perdue's evidence Perdue's campaign said Ossoff's 'socialist agenda' includes support for defunding the police, 'government-controlled health care,' the Green New Deal and 'no borders.' Leaving aside whether any of those positions amounts to socialism, Ossoff has said he opposes defunding the police; opposes Medicare for All and supports private insurance; opposes the Green New Deal; and opposes abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while supporting 'strong border security.' Perdue's campaign also said Ossoff supports sanctuary cities, higher taxes and changing the makeup of the Senate to 'favor Democrats.' None of those positions is socialism. Ossoff has said, 'I don't think it's the role of local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law,' but has not stated support for sanctuary cities. He 'supports lower taxes for all but the wealthiest Americans.' Ossoff does support statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which are seen as more likely to elect Democratic senators. Perdue's campaign also said Ossoff is a socialist because of support from Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and 'California liberals.' But Ossoff doesn't support Sanders' Medicare for All, under which a single, national health insurance program would cover everyone who lives in the United States; or Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, which is centered on climate change, but incorporates everything from racial justice to labor union policy. 'It's somewhat difficult to classify Ossoff ideologically, as he has never held elective office and has a relatively brief history in the public spotlight,' said Zachary Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. 'With that caveat in mind, his campaign statements and debate performances are consistent with a middle-of-the-road Democrat.' Jeffrey Lazarus, a political science professor at Georgia State University, also described Ossoff as mainstream. 'Forget for a moment the massive levels of misunderstanding that pervade discourse around the word socialism. Looking just at Ossoff's policy positions, they're pretty mainstream Democratic policy positions,' Lazarus said.

One of his points is that the Democrats' policies on the economy are better than the Republicans. 'Along with tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they'll stop government spending,' Obama said. 'Of course, they are right to be concerned about the long-term deficit -- if we don't get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it's time for government to show some discipline too. 'But let's look at the facts. When these same Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down.' 'Mr. Boehner' is Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. Obama mentioned him by name about half a dozen times in his speech on Sept. 8, 2010. We knew earmarks had gone up during the Bush administration, but we weren't sure how they tracked Republican majorities in Congress. Republicans held control of Congress for most of the period from 1995 to 2006. (In 2001, Democrats briefly re-took control of the Senate but lost it again in 2003.) So we decided to check it out. Generally speaking, earmarks are spending that individual members of Congress request for particular programs or projects. Earmarks usually don't go through the normal vetting processes to make sure the projects are worthy. They're often considered a perk for members of Congress to fund their favorite projects. We turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an nonpartisan advocacy group that fights wasteful spending in Congress. The group opposes earmarks because they circumvent normal budget processes, crowd out funding for merit-based projects and invite corruption. We asked vice president Steve Ellis whether earmarks went up, not down, under the Republican-controlled Congresses. 'Totally true,' Ellis said. 'Certainly under the Republicans there was a big rise in earmarks.' The high mark was fiscal 2005, the last fiscal year before Democrats won control, when Congress passed bills with approximately 16,000 earmarks, Ellis said. We were able to find other sources that agreed with Ellis. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service documented increasing earmarks in different parts of appropriations bills in its report Earmarks in Appropriation Acts: FY1994, FY1996, FY1998, FY2000, FY2002, FY2004, FY2005. The conservative Heritage Foundation included a striking chart on earmarks in its Federal Spending by the Numbers 2010 report. It reported a slightly different number of earmarks, at approximately 14,000 earmarks in 2005. But that was the largest number of earmarks between 1991 and 2010, and a significant increase from 1994, when there were fewer than 2,000. We asked Ellis why earmarks increased so steadily during the years Republicans controlled Congress, and he said there were several factors at work. Prior to Republican control, Ellis said, Democrats reserved earmarks for committee chairman and other powerful leaders. Under Republicans, more rank-and-file members of Congress were allowed to insert earmarks into bills. The Republicans allowed Democrats to insert earmarks as well, so Democrats were not so quick to criticize what the Republicans were doing, he said. Finally, special interests got better at lobbying members of Congress, using new technology like cell phones and Blackberrys to communicate with members as legislation was being put together. That new technology, though, also allowed citizens to document and share information about earmarks, which led to widespread outrage that resulted in earmark reforms when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, bringing more transparency to the process. 'The more people could look at earmarks and analyze them, the more they could see what Congress was doing and criticize it,' Ellis said. But transparency on earmarks doesn't mean earmarks have gone away. During the campaign, Obama promised to reduce earmarks to $7.8 billion a year, what they were at in 1994. Here at PolitiFact, we rated that Promise Broken. The last budget for fiscal year 2010 included 9,499 earmarks worth $15.9 billion, according to an analysis from Taxpayers for Common Sense. We should note that earlier this year, House Republicans voluntarily agreed to a one-year moratorium on earmarks. House Democrats agreed to a ban on earmarks that benefit for-profit companies but not on earmarks for local government projects or nonprofit projects. Senators of both parties continue to earmark. And finally, it's important to note that other Republicans may like earmarking, but Boehner is not among them. In 2009, we fact-checked his statement, 'I don't do earmarks. I've never done one,' and rated it True. He hasn't taken an earmark since he was elected to Congress in 1990. Boehner's staff also pointed out that Boehner was not in leadership for all of the years Republicans controlled Congress; he did not have a leadership position between 1998 and 2006. And in 2006, the year Boehner was majority leader, earmarks declined from the 2005 high, they said. Getting back to our rating, Obama said that 'When these same Republicans - including Mr. Boehner - were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down.' Earmarks increased dramatically between 1995 and 2006, so we find Obama's statement that earmarks went up, not down, to be correct. But he also singles out Boehner by name, when Boehner didn't take any earmarks and wasn't in leadership for most of those years. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

Obama mentioned him by name about half a dozen times in his speech on Sept. 8, 2010. We knew earmarks had gone up during the Bush administration, but we weren't sure how they tracked Republican majorities in Congress. Republicans held control of Congress for most of the period from 1995 to 2006. (In 2001, Democrats briefly re-took control of the Senate but lost it again in 2003.) So we decided to check it out. Generally speaking, earmarks are spending that individual members of Congress request for particular programs or projects. Earmarks usually don't go through the normal vetting processes to make sure the projects are worthy. They're often considered a perk for members of Congress to fund their favorite projects. We turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an nonpartisan advocacy group that fights wasteful spending in Congress. The group opposes earmarks because they circumvent normal budget processes, crowd out funding for merit-based projects and invite corruption. We asked vice president Steve Ellis whether earmarks went up, not down, under the Republican-controlled Congresses. 'Totally true,' Ellis said. 'Certainly under the Republicans there was a big rise in earmarks.' The high mark was fiscal 2005, the last fiscal year before Democrats won control, when Congress passed bills with approximately 16,000 earmarks, Ellis said. We were able to find other sources that agreed with Ellis. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service documented increasing earmarks in different parts of appropriations bills in its report Earmarks in Appropriation Acts: FY1994, FY1996, FY1998, FY2000, FY2002, FY2004, FY2005. The conservative Heritage Foundation included a striking chart on earmarks in its Federal Spending by the Numbers 2010 report. It reported a slightly different number of earmarks, at approximately 14,000 earmarks in 2005. But that was the largest number of earmarks between 1991 and 2010, and a significant increase from 1994, when there were fewer than 2,000. We asked Ellis why earmarks increased so steadily during the years Republicans controlled Congress, and he said there were several factors at work. Prior to Republican control, Ellis said, Democrats reserved earmarks for committee chairman and other powerful leaders. Under Republicans, more rank-and-file members of Congress were allowed to insert earmarks into bills. The Republicans allowed Democrats to insert earmarks as well, so Democrats were not so quick to criticize what the Republicans were doing, he said. Finally, special interests got better at lobbying members of Congress, using new technology like cell phones and Blackberrys to communicate with members as legislation was being put together. That new technology, though, also allowed citizens to document and share information about earmarks, which led to widespread outrage that resulted in earmark reforms when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, bringing more transparency to the process. 'The more people could look at earmarks and analyze them, the more they could see what Congress was doing and criticize it,' Ellis said. But transparency on earmarks doesn't mean earmarks have gone away. During the campaign, Obama promised to reduce earmarks to $7.8 billion a year, what they were at in 1994. Here at PolitiFact, we rated that Promise Broken. The last budget for fiscal year 2010 included 9,499 earmarks worth $15.9 billion, according to an analysis from Taxpayers for Common Sense. We should note that earlier this year, House Republicans voluntarily agreed to a one-year moratorium on earmarks. House Democrats agreed to a ban on earmarks that benefit for-profit companies but not on earmarks for local government projects or nonprofit projects. Senators of both parties continue to earmark. And finally, it's important to note that other Republicans may like earmarking, but Boehner is not among them. In 2009, we fact-checked his statement, 'I don't do earmarks. I've never done one,' and rated it True. He hasn't taken an earmark since he was elected to Congress in 1990. Boehner's staff also pointed out that Boehner was not in leadership for all of the years Republicans controlled Congress; he did not have a leadership position between 1998 and 2006. And in 2006, the year Boehner was majority leader, earmarks declined from the 2005 high, they said. Getting back to our rating, Obama said that 'When these same Republicans - including Mr. Boehner - were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down.' Earmarks increased dramatically between 1995 and 2006, so we find Obama's statement that earmarks went up, not down, to be correct. But he also singles out Boehner by name, when Boehner didn't take any earmarks and wasn't in leadership for most of those years. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",,,,"'When these same Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Osteen had his on-call yacht captain steer the large vessel through the flooded streets of the city, pulling up to survivors stranded on their roofs and on the roof of their cars as the prosperity gospel preacher smiled, waved, and threw out signed editions of the bestselling positive thinking book ... Osteen also paused for brief photo ops with several families, the smiling pastor briefly allowing them to board his yacht as his professional photography team got shots of the pastor together with the sobbing, distraught flood victims, though the pastor was careful to not stand too close to the mud-caked refugees.

20602,9054,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tijuana-transfer/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"While ISIS exploded across global headlines as a growing threat in the Middle East in 2014, so too did American fears that agents of the Islamic State would silently filter through U.S. borders and quietly live amongst Americans while waiting to strike. Rumors of ISIS members slipping through southern borders escalated significantly on 7 October 2014 when U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter of California told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that as many as ten ISIS militants had been apprehended at southern crossings. Van Susteren pressed Hunter after he stated that ISIS members had been caught attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, following a broader statement by the Congressman on concern for border security. Hunter replied by saying: ISIS is coming across the southern border. They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico. I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas. Van Susteren questioned Hunter on why he specifically believed ten ISIS members had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and were caught, to which he replied that 'Border Patrol' had confirmed the information to him. Hunter stated that Border Patrol agents 'caught' those ISIS insurgents but added that 'there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.' Hunter's claims seemed to fall directly in line with several made by the disreputable Judicial Watch site, a muckraking organization run by 'political activist' Larry Klayman (who issued a press release in October 2014 announcing he was petitioning several federal agencies to deport President Obama, and who has been barred for life by multiple judges for his repetitive misuse of the court system). Since August 2014, Judicial Watch has been claiming that the U.S.-Mexico border is vulnerable to ISIS, stating in a 'bulletin' on 10 October 2014 that: There are times when all of us hate to say, 'I told you so.' And the latest news from Judicial Watch on the apprehension of ISIS terrorists on the U.S.-Mexico border is certainly one of them.In late August, you may recall, JW broke the story that Islamic terrorist organizations are operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez where they plan to stage attacks against the U.S. In response to this threat, agents in the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense had all been placed on alert and told to work to counter the imminent threat. Two days after our initial report, Fort Bliss, the massive installation in El Paso, increased its security in response to this international terrorist threat. But then the Obama spin machine cranked up. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security officially denied the report, telling the London Daily Mail, 'we are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim.' The DHS official duplicitously added, 'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also responded, telling the newspaper that 'the most detailed intelligence assessment that I can offer from here is that there is no evidence or indication right now that [the Islamic State group] is actively plotting to attack the United States homeland. That's true right now.' At Judicial Watch, we pulled no punches in standing by our story. We told the Daily Mail that JW's sources were 'golden,' and that the government's denial constituted a 'non-denial denial.' As I pointed out, the words 'credible' and 'specific' were rhetorical loopholes that one 'could drive a truck bomb through,' the paper reported. In the original 'bulletin' issued by Judicial Watch on 31 August 2014, the site claimed an attack by ISIS due to border porosity was imminent. The report heavily implied the anniversary of the September 11 attacks as a potential attack date and claimed that: Intelligence officials have picked up radio talk and chatter indicating that the terrorist groups are going to 'carry out an attack on the border,' according to one JW source. 'It's coming very soon,' according to another high-level source, who clearly identified the groups planning the plots as 'ISIS and Al Qaeda.' An attack is so imminent that the commanding general at Ft. Bliss, the U.S. Army post in El Paso, is being briefed, JW's sources say. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to multiple inquiries from Judicial Watch, both telephonic and in writing, about this information. The claims by Judicial Watch of an 'imminent' attack 'coming very soon' were made on 31 August 2014, and Hunter's statements came more than a month later. No such attack or confirmed attempt to cross the border by members of ISIS occurred in the intervening weeks between the 'bulletin' and Hunter's appearance on Fox News to substantiate beliefs that ISIS either had crossed or had intended to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The inclusion in the rumor of an 'in the last 36 hours' modifier created an impression of urgency without specifying when the event itself occurred (and enabled the rumor to spread ad infinitum.) On 8 October 2014, a senior spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security responded to Hunter's claim about ISIS fighters captured by Border Patrol: The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border. No reports of any arrests matching the claims made by Hunter or Judicial Watch materialized in the time the rumor has been circulating, and it seems safe to say at this remove that the 36-hour timeframe has come and gone without incident. Judicial Watch similarly claimed in an April 2015 article that 'ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas,' 'in an area known as 'Anapra' situated just west of Ciudad Juárez in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.' Several federal law agencies involved with border security said the report was unverified and that it was unlikely ISIS is in Anapra or Juarez, and Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, Mexico's minister for press and public affairs, also disclaimed the report: The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua - El Paso, Texas.The relevant authorities operating in the region have also confirmed the inexistence of these activities with their US counterparts, with whom they will continue to work closely and to exchange information at our common border.' Moreover, El Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke debunked this rumor on Facebook: Today I reached out to the Mexican government, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Northern Command.None of them have found any evidence, credible or otherwise, that Isis is in Juárez. Stories like these are good at scaring people and getting attention for those who spread them. But they are terrible for the country's image of the border, for El Paso's ability to recruit talent, and for our region's opportunity to capitalize on the benefits of being the largest bi-national community in the world. As a member of the House Homeland Security committee in the 113th Congress, I asked the director of the FBI, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Secretary of Homeland Security if there was currently any terrorist threat on the Southern border. They answered that there was not, nor had there ever been, any terrorist, terrorist plot, or terrorist organization that was able to exploit our border with Mexico. Beyond hurting our image nationally, these kinds of false stories could lead us to take our eye off real threats to the homeland. While we should always remain vigilant at our borders - and we currently spend $18 billion a year to do so - the greatest proven homeland threats have been at our airports and with homegrown terrorists radicalized over the internet. Not in El Paso, the country's safest city 4 years in a row.",Is ISIS on the U.S.-Mexican Border?

So at the very least, Obey's plan addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head-on. But the fact we're checking here is whether eliminating those for-profit earmarks would leave 90 percent of earmarks untouched. It would. There are differences of opinion on both sides of the aisle about whether that's necessarily a bad thing. But DeMint's math is accurate. And we rate his statement True.","No sooner had Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations panel, announced a plan to ban earmarks to for-profit companies than Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., sent out a blast of one-upmanship via Twitter. 'House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks,' DeMint wrote. 'That's a fig leaf, not real reform.' While Congress has steadily moved toward tighter earmark restrictions over the last several years, the issue has taken on renewed steam in light of the massive budget deficit and several high-profile ethics investigations. On Feb. 26, the House ethics committee absolved seven members of the defense spending panel accused of awarding earmarks to companies whose executives and lobbyists donated to their campaigns. Although they were cleared, the ethics committee said it was evident there was at least a perception among corporate donors that political donations have an impact on a legislator's decision to author an earmark for that company. It was just that kind of conflict that Rep. Obey said he was trying to eliminate when on March 10, 2010, he initiated a ban on budget earmarks to private, for-profit companies. The move -- one of several earmark reforms Obey instituted for the House -- was hailed by several government watchdog groups as a meaningful step for earmark reform. 'For-profit company earmarks are ground zero for pay-to-play,' said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But what about DeMint's Twitter claim that Obey's 'partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks.' By Obey's calculation (or more accurately, the research of his House Appropriation Committee staff) the ban on earmarks to for-profit companies would have eliminated about 1,000 earmarks this year, which came to a total of about $1.7 billion. Taxpayers for Common Sense, which looked not only at the roughly 9,000 disclosed earmarks this fiscal year but also pored through the budget and came up with several hundred more projects it deemed to be earmarks, put the total number of earmarks at 9,499, totaling $15.9 billion. That puts the number of earmarks not going to for-profits awfully close to DeMint's 90 percent. Democrats don't really take issue with that statistic. It's what citing that figure implies, as well as the follow-up comment that Obey's ban of earmarks to for-profits is 'a fig leaf, not real reform.' ''The political reality right now is that the public has lost some confidence in this institution, and one of the reasons is the past abuses of the earmark process,'' Obey told the New York Times. Earmarks for profit-making companies are ''the most vulnerable place'' for abuse in the system, he said. 'It's a step forward,' Ellis said. 'It's not the answer, the be-all-end-all. But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. It's real. We've been making progress on earmarks for several years now. And I'm fine with that. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.' The day after Obey announced the changes, House Republicans went one step further, saying their members would renounce all earmarks for the rest of the year. In the Senate, however, banning any earmarks has much less traction. Senate Appropriations panel chair Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, Obey's Senate counterpart and a staunch defender of earmarks, called Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits 'quizzical.' 'Many, if not most, for-profit and nonprofit entities lobby for themselves or employ lobbyists,' Inouye told AP. 'That is how most of them make the Congress aware of their products and services. It is no secret that many of these individuals make political contributions. All lobbyists file disclosure reports. These contributions are all fully disclosed and available for all to see on the Internet.' Inouye told the New York Times that the partial ban amounted to Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, that current earmark restrictions were already working and that ''it does not make sense to discriminate against for-profit organizations'' by banning earmarks to them. A difference in earmark policy between the two chambers would certainly make for some interesting drama when the House and Senate begin to reconcile spending bills later this year. But DeMint, a self-described 'recovering earmarker,' would like to nip this issue in the bud now. DeMint vowed to force a Senate vote on a proposal he introduced earlier this year -- along with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and 15 Republican co-sponsors -- that would put a one-year moratorium on all earmarks. In the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, DeMint floated a similar moratorium proposal. The bill was co-sponsored by then-presidential front-runners John McCain as well as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but it failed by a vote of 71-29. 'The Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a stop to this wasteful spending,' DeMint said. 'Our nation is drowning in debt that will be paid by our children and we'll never stop Washington's spending addiction unless members of both parties take bold action. We need to focus on balancing the budget, not pork barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges to nowhere, teapot museums and monuments to politicians.' Obey told the New York Times that banning all earmarks would make Congress ''a rubber stamp'' of the executive branch. ''Where I come from, the Congress has a perfect right, in fact an obligation, to participate in the budget process, but we've got to try to do it in a way that protects the integrity of the system,'' he said. ''This strikes a reasonable balance.'' Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said a one-year moratorium is great, 'but to what end?' A moratorium puts off the issue for a year, he said, but Congress still needs a long-term fix to its spending protocol. Some of the projects financed by earmarks are worthy of federal dollars, Ellis said. The problem, he said, is that earmarks are based more on the political muscle of their sponsors than project merit. We think DeMint is a little too dismissive when he calls Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits a 'fig leaf.' As the recent ethics report found, private companies certainly believe their contributions win them earmarks. And it's naive to think they don't. So at the very least, Obey's plan addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head-on. But the fact we're checking here is whether eliminating those for-profit earmarks would leave 90 percent of earmarks untouched. It would.

6949,7129,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/roy-moore-muslims-serve-congress/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Alabama Senatorial candidate Roy Moore has led a controversial public career, to say the least. Its highlights include being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union when he was Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for erecting a monument bearing the Ten Commandments in the court building in 2001, and being dismissed from the bench by a state judiciary panel in 2003 for refusing to remove it. He was also an unapologetic 'birther,' freely promoting and promulgating roundly disproven rumors that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States and was secretly a Muslim, and argued that 'homosexual conduct' should be illegal. Although his views struck a chord with a subset of Alabama voters, propelling him to the Republican Party nomination in a run for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, at least one member of his own party, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), refused to endorse him on the grounds that Moore had 'expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith': When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim shouldn't be a member of Congress because of his religious faith, it was wrong. That this same judge is now my party's nominee for the Senate from Alabama should concern us all. Religious tests should have no place in the Senate. Standing up for people of faith, whether Muslim or Catholic, who are facing unfair prejudice should be an act of basic conscience. It should be expected of all of us, regardless of party. In point of fact, imposing any sort of religious test as a qualification to hold office in the United States government is a violation of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, which reads: The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. Moore made the statement Flake was referring to in a December 2006 op-ed piece on the conservative web site WorldNetDaily concerning the election to the U.S. House of Representatives of Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota), a Muslim. The article was unambiguously titled 'Muslim Ellison Should Not Sit in Congress' and compared allowing Ellison to go through with his expressed intention to be sworn in on the Quran instead of the Bible to allowing members of Congress to take their oaths on a copy of Mein Kampf: Our Constitution states, 'Each House [of Congress] shall be the judge ... of the qualifications of its own members.' Enough evidence exists for Congress to question Ellison's qualifications to be a member of Congress as well as his commitment to the Constitution in view of his apparent determination to embrace the Quran and an Islamic philosophy directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution. But common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine. In 1943, we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on 'Mein Kampf,' or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the 'Communist Manifesto.' Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today! When asked by an MSNBC reporter in October 2017 if he stands by those views, Moore replied in the affirmative: Read my article and you'll find out what I believe. It's clarified very clearly in my article. In addition to criticism of his extreme views, Moore was hit in November 2017 with allegations (as yet unproven) that as a thirtysomething assistant district attorney in Etowah County, Alabama he initiated sexual encounters with underaged girls - including one who was allegedly just 14 years old.","Did Roy Moore Say Muslims Shouldn't Be Allowed to Serve in Congress?

Apparently, they thought their commercials were more important than showing this scene for about 5 seconds.On the evening of 14 November 2011, the NFL's Green Bay Packers hosted the Minnesota Vikings in a football match-up held at Lambeau Field in Green Bay which was televised by ESPN as part of that network's Monday Night Football schedule. As the previous Friday (11 November) had been Veterans Day, the Packers announced they would be staging a number of Veterans Day-themed events before the game and during halftime:The Green Bay Packers' Monday night game against the Minnesota Vikings is dedicated to showing appreciation to the U.S. Military through a variety of activities in recognition of Veteran's Day. Upon entering Lambeau Field fans will receive an American flag, compliments of the Wisconsin Army National Guard and Oshkosh Defense. Attendees will also take part in an in-stadium USAA card stunt to thank veterans and current military for their service. The USO of Wisconsin will be standing by with Oshkosh Defense in the parking lot to accept phone cards for the military. People can drop off phone calling cards to the USO reps at the Oshkosh Defense M-ATV, or can donate cash to be used to purchase cards for their 'Operation Phone Home' efforts. If bringing cards, people are encouraged to get international cards, which provide the most reliable service for the military members. Other military-themed activities scheduled include a large on-field flag with stars representing all military branches during the national anthem, military shout-outs on TundraVision, and a halftime show featuring the Wisconsin National Guard 132nd Army Band and fireworks display. The Packers and WPS will also be recognizing and welcoming home 1st Lieutenant Infantry Officer Kent Gavin through Operation Fan Mail on-field prior to the national anthem. Gavin will be accompanied by his fiancée and her parents. The national anthem will be performed by Steel Magnolia's Meghan Linsey and Joshua Scott Jones.Some of those activities, such as the pre-game card stunts in which the stadium crowd spelled out messages including 'Thank You Veterans' and 'Thank You Military' and the unfurling of a large flag on the field during the playing of the national anthem, were captured in the photographs displayed above and audience videos such as the following:Within days of the game, reports (such as the following account from Milwaukee television station WTMJ) began to trickle out expressing disappointment that only spectators present at the game had been able to view the pre-game Veterans Day tribute activities at Lambeau Field, as ESPN did not include them in their telecast:Packers fans inside Lambeau Field had a chance to take part in a special moment to honor America's veterans before the Packers-Vikings game Monday night. Most of them raised a card to help form a pattern that said 'Thank You Veterans' and American flags. However, most of the nation did not see the tribute, as ESPN-TV was taking a commercial break during the national anthem.We contacted ESPN to invite them to explain the circumstances behind why the tribute had not been aired, and they sent us the following response:We appreciate and applaud these entertainers for their hard work and talent, but exposure of them before games and at halftime can't be guaranteed. Our pre-game and halftime features have proven to be very popular with our fans and they've come to depend on tuning into ESPN, The World's Biggest Sports Fan, to catch up-to-date scores and sports news.This theme was played upon in a satirical 31 January 2012 Daily Spoof article which posited that the performance of the U.S. national anthem before the upcoming Super Bowl XLVI game would be pre-empted on television by a commercial for Dodge trucks:Football fans watching Super Bowl XLVI can remain seated during the pregame ceremonies this year, because the singing of The Star-Spangled Banner will be preempted by a television commercial for Dodge trucks. 'At $7 million a minute, we can't spare the time it takes for the National Anthem to be performed,' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell explained. 'And don't try to accuse us of being unpatriotic here. No one's a bigger fan of Belichick and Brady than I am. It's just that the advertiser made us an offer we can't refuse.' The sponsor of the ad, the Chrysler Corporation, is now owned by the Italian automaker Fiat.Some readers who encountered this article out of its original context took it seriously, but as noted in the article's disclaimer, 'The story above is a satire or parody.

His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point. The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The country's spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the country's biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare. The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit. We rate the claim Mostly True. Share the Facts Politifact 2 7 Politifact Rating: Mostly True We've seen 'our deficits cut by two-thirds.' Barack Obama President In his 2015 State of the Union address Tuesday, January 20, 2015 01/20/2015 Read More info","When President Barack Obama reflects on 2014, he brings up a litany of highlights that include drawing down the Afghanistan war and Americans signing up for health insurance thanks to his health care law. Oh, and slicing up the deficit. Obama is super-pumped about that. He made a point to brag about the deficit's drop in his 2015 State of the Union address. 'At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,' Obama said. 'Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.' Is he right about the deficit dropping by two-thirds? What the White House says As a reminder, don't get the deficit twisted with the debt. They are only related, not the same. The country's annual deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, is the net of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. To back up his claim, Obama is comparing his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014. The White House is breaking down the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and not actual dollars. Economists told us this is a valid way of analyzing the deficit, because it factors in the economy's change over time. The White House sent us this chart, which relies on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2009, which started almost four months before Obama's presidency began and ended eight months into it, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. The 2014 shortfall is 2.8 percent of GDP -- a decrease of 71 percent. So that's where the claim comes from. The situation largely tracks if you use real dollars. Using the same comparison with Congressional Budget Office figures, the deficit fell from $1.4 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year to $486 billion in the 2014 fiscal year -- a drop of about 66 percent. Why the drop might not be so exciting Experts told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats. First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 (hence the steady drop). In 2008, the deficit was $458 billion, or 3.1 percent of GDP. Those deficits are smaller than the ones the country is facing today. The 2009 fiscal year represented a huge jump in the deficit, partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy. 'This is not to say that that large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different,' said Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law. Also, some economists we consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama's first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year. And there's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen said the more important question is if Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. 'And the answer is no,' Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform. The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point. Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. Federal spending is projected to increase through 2039, so much so that by then the federal debt held by the public will reach a point only seen after World War II. The deficit would be equal to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2029 and 6.5 percent of GDP by 2039, a higher deficit than any year between 1947 and 2008. This chart from the Congressional Budget Office shows how the deficit is not expected to continue its downward trend in recent years. A final word on Obama's point from the experts. The deficit has come down in recent years because of the strengthening economy, which drives tax revenues up, and the draw-down of various economic stimulus programs that were implemented to weather the financial crisis. Additionally, the expiration of 2 percent payroll tax cuts and increases in tax rates for high-income earners played a role, albeit a smaller one. 'It's not clear one would want to view the evolution as relating to fiscal responsibility rather than an improving economy,' Auerbach said.",,,,We've seen 'our deficits cut by two-thirds.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

As a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns. In short, his gun record is nuanced. Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment. It is possible to support the Second Amendment and favor some regulation on guns. Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Kander's claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/05a77216-92bf-4df3-933b-6d093512c2a7","In a September campaign TV spot that has gained national attention, Jason Kander assembles a military assault rifle while blindfolded. Kander, who is Missouri's secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, puts together an AR-15 in 30 seconds. As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns Kander, a former Army captain, says 'In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle.' He continues to say, 'In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights,' while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 'out of the hands of terrorists.' Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state. We wanted to know more about how Kander handled Second Amendment issues as a representative, so we decided to investigate his claim. Voting record We asked Kander's campaign about his statement, and his staff sent us part of his voting record. In 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age - from 23 to 21- at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law. In 2012, he voted to lower the conceal-and-carry age from 21 to 18 for military members. That bill also became law. That same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect 'the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms.' The resolution died in a Senate committee. But that's only part of the story when it comes to Kander and gun legislation. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund gave Kander an 'F' rating on his advocacy for the Second Amendment for 2016. It provided us with more information about Kander's voting record. In 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus. Kander voted against the 'Business Premises Safety Act' four times - once during each of his terms as a state representative. That bill would have prevented business owners from restricting people from lawfully possessing a firearm in a car on business property. Both the NRA and incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, Kander's opponent, have released ads in response to Kander's ad, denouncing his claim that he supports the Second Amendment. What the Supreme Court says about the Second Amendment In a 2010 landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment prohibition against infringement on the right to 'keep and bear arms' extends to state and local governments. But the court has also ruled in the 2008 case of District of Columbia v. Heller that some restrictions on guns are acceptable. In the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is 'not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.' He went on to say that some restrictions, like the prohibition of guns in churches and government buildings, were not affected by the court's decision. Carrying a concealed weapon is also subject to regulation. Kander's votes against expanding access to guns fall within the Supreme Court's definition of allowable regulation of the Second Amendment. He has never proposed, or voted for, a bill that would repeal the Second Amendment or flout the Supreme Court's interpretation of the amendment, our review found. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and well-known constitutional law expert, said in an email that analysis of Kander's stance on the Second Amendment depends on two questions: 'Does one believe that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns?' and 'Are particular regulations of guns desirable?' 'Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing,' he said. 'Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns.' Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law, agreed. 'The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home,' he said in an email. 'So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms.'",,,,"'In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

It has to be very specific to the matter at hand.' It's not as settled by law as de Blasio makes it sound, but experts say generally that the mayor is correct. The Supreme Court, in South Dakota vs. Dole, concluded that Congress could not coerce local governments to act based on the threat of withholding federal funds. Also, any funds that are withheld must be germane to the reason they are being withheld. The court ruling dealt with Congress, however, and not the executive, and there is ambiguity about both what tactic Trump might pursue and the legal precedence behind it. De Blasio's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate de Blasio's claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3dd2f041-14be-448f-b001-103b6ad8d56a","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn't backing away from policies that protect immigrants living illegally in the country, even if that means cuts to his city's budget. President-elect Donald Trump has said he will block federal funds to cities with policies or laws that limit their assistance to immigration authorities. New York is among jurisdictions considered a 'sanctuary city.' The Democratic mayor was asked on WNYC's The Brian Lehrer Show how funding would be affected if Trump follows through on his promise. 'I think the first thing is to recognize that from what I know so far because of a decision by the Supreme Court, no president's in a position to cut off funding across the board. It has to be very specific to the matter at hand,' de Blasio said. 'If we disagree in one particular policy area, there may be opportunities for the federal government to say, 'well we are not going to fund you in that policy area,' but not across the board.' As other mayors across the country stand behind their immigrant-friendly policies, we wondered about de Blasio's comment on how much is at stake. Can funding be restrained in certain areas but not 'across the board,' as de Blasio said? A key Supreme Court case The mayor's press office told us he was referring to the 1987 landmark case South Dakota vs. Dole, which the mayor's press office concluded 'that federal conditions have to be reasonable and related to the programs they are attached to.' South Dakota vs. Dole examined whether Congress exceeded its spending powers and violated the 21st Amendment (allowing states to regulate alcohol) by setting conditions for states to receive federal highway funds. Congress in 1984 enacted legislation that allowed the secretary of the Transportation Department to withhold 5 percent of federal highway funds from states where the minimum drinking age was below 21. South Dakota allowed 19-year-olds to buy alcohol. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court determined that Congress within constitutional bounds 'acted indirectly under its spending power to encourage uniformity in the states' drinking ages.' The court also said spending power must be in pursuit of 'the general welfare.' Conditions set by Congress for the disbursement of funds must also be unambiguous, related to the national project or program, not lead to unconstitutional actions and not be coercive, the court affirmed. Constitutional law experts told us de Blasio's comment is generally sound, but noted that the Dole case is specifically about congressional spending power, not presidential authority. 'If Trump was referring to the possibility of congressional legislation that would make continued funding contingent on cooperation with federal immigration policy, then we have a possible Dole situation,' said Christopher W. Schmidt, a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology. Imposing across-the-board spending cuts for 'sanctuary cities' would run afoul with at least one of the criteria set in the 1987 Supreme Court case - that conditions on spending be related to the national program that Congress is seeking to advance, said Franita Tolson, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. For instance, if the federal government gives New York money for mass transit, and New York doesn't want to participate in a federal initiative for education, the federal government can't in turn threaten the mass transit funds, said Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan. Trump's administration 'can't cut off any federal grants to sanctuary cities unless it can show that those grants were clearly conditioned on cooperation with federal deportation policies,' Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, wrote in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post. Conditions for funds also cannot be so great that the threat of losing federal money amounts to coercion, Primus said. Scholars pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business vs. Sebelius, in which seven of the nine justices said it would be unconstitutionally coercive for Congress to withdraw Medicaid funds from states refusing to participate in the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. 'One might argue that the larger the amount of money at stake (or the 'broader' the threatened cut), the more coercive the condition, but there are other factors to be taken into account as well,' said Lana Ulrich, associate in-house counsel at the National Constitution Center. In the case of sanctuary cities, spending power might be interpreted differently, Ulrich said. At issue might be the extent to which Congress may condition grants or whether Congress has the discretion to withhold funds for cities that are not in compliance with federal law,' Ulrich said. Trump has not outlined extended details on his sanctuary city proposal, but he said that cities that refuse to assist federal authorities 'will not receive taxpayer dollars.'",,,,"On Donald Trump's plan to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities, 'because of a decision by the Supreme Court, no president's in a position to cut off funding across the board.

4643,118882,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/20/joe-biden/biden-mischaracterizes-teacher-layoffs-pandemic/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling Biden said, '666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March.' The 666,000 figure comes from federal data, but it doesn't describe teacher layoffs. We don't actually know how many teachers have been laid off due to the pandemic. The 666,000 number reflects the net decrease in local government education jobs since March, but it's not specific to teachers or job losses due to layoffs. It includes job losses by other school staff, such as cafeteria and custodial workers. We rate Biden's claim Mostly False.","Speaking about the economic toll facing public schools, President-elect Joe Biden overstated the number of teachers who have been laid off since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 'There's already a circumstance where nationwide, because of the requirement of school districts, county offices, mayors, governors having to balance their budgets, they've already had to lay off 666,000 teachers,' Biden said Nov. 18 during a virtual event with frontline workers. '666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March,' he repeated. Biden is right that the pandemic has challenged public schools. Many teachers are at high risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, and many school districts are strapped for funds as they try to balance their budgets without more assistance from the federal government. But the former vice president's assertion that schools have laid off 666,000 teachers since March is inflated. The number he cited refers to the roughly 666,000 local government education jobs that went away between March and October, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of those workers were teachers, and not all of them were laid off. The Biden team did not respond to requests for comment. Not all school staff are teachers The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data that shows net changes in the number of people employed in an industry from month to month. For 'local government education,' an industry that primarily consists of jobs in public K-12 schools, the data shows that the number of workers dropped from 8,041,600 in March to 7,375,800 in October. That's a net loss of about 665,800 workers. Between February and October, the decline was about 666,200 workers. The latter number - 666,200 - was cited in a Nov. 10 report by Pew Charitable Trusts. But Pew described the figure accurately as a net decrease in local government education jobs. 'Those aren't necessarily going to be teachers,' said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute who has written about public education job losses in the pandemic. A BLS spokesperson said industries such as local government education can contain hundreds of different occupations, from librarians and coaches to administrators and custodial or cafeteria employees. The agency doesn't collect data that would show job losses just among teachers. In 2019, non-instructional staffers accounted for roughly 30% of all full-time equivalent jobs in public elementary and secondary schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Net change versus layoffs The second problem with Biden's claim is that the 666,000 lost jobs are not all attributable to layoffs. Experts said there's no data source to show a precise count of how many teachers have been laid off since the start of the pandemic. First grade teacher Megan Garner-Jones teaches students participating remotely and in person during the pandemic at School 16 on Oct. 20, 2020, in Yonkers, N.Y. (AP) The BLS does track the number of layoffs and discharges by industry each month. But it lumps together data for local government education with state government education, which includes public colleges and universities. Faced with the health threat of COVID-19, reports show some teachers have also quit, taken leaves of absence or retired. A survey of educators that Education Week conducted in July found many teachers saying they were likely to leave their jobs this year due to the pandemic, although the outlet reported recently that it's unclear how many actually stepped away. One reason why there haven't been more teachers laid off is that public sector layoffs often lag when recessions hit, said Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality. Another reason is that many school districts are bound by contracts and laws that restrict when teachers can be notified of layoffs.

Experts say missile testing has certainly increased, and at least one analysis shows that increase was close to what Burr said.

Richard Burr U.S. Senator Youngsville, N.C. Tuesday, April 18, 2017 2017-04-18 Read More info","Shortly after North Korea failed to launch a missile in an attempted show of force, one of the U.S. congressmen who keeps a particularly close eye on the erratic dictatorship had a warning. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a group of constituents at a meeting in Youngsville, N.C., that North Korea's latest actions were 'something to really be concerned about.' Burr went on to explain two reasons for his warning. One, he said, is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be crazy. The other, he said, is that Kim has significantly ramped up missile development and testing since taking over for his father, the late Kim Jong-il. 'When you do things like he does, you automatically assume he's crazy,' Burr said of Kim Jong Un. 'The pace of missile development between his father's term and his term has increased the testing about twenty-fold.' There has been plenty of bluster and confusion surrounding the country's missile launch lately - including the launch itself, a pre-launch parade replete with new military technology, and the Trump administration saying it had sent an aircraft carrier strike force to the area when, in reality, the ships were thousands of miles away and sailing in the opposite direction. So in the midst of so much noise, we wanted to know if Burr was right. Specifically, we looked into his claim that 'the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold.' A tiny but well-armed country In terms of troops, North Korea has one of the world's largest militaries, along with the United States (a major adversary), China (its biggest ally) and India. Kim Jong Il wasn't hesitant to build and test missiles, much to the dismay of neighboring countries. So increasing missile activity by a factor of 20 would require serious commitment by the younger Kim. Burr's office didn't respond when we asked where he got his information. He is, of course, privy to all sorts of secret reports and briefings we don't have at our own disposal. He's the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the 17 U.S. spy agencies. But we don't think he would have unveiled classified information. And from the information that is public, it appears Burr is more or less correct. Missile testing and development We interviewed multiple North Korea experts, none of whom said they could verify the numerical accuracy of Burr's claim - especially as it relates to missile development. Missile tests can be counted, but it's harder to quantify the speed at which new technologies are being developed and perfected. 'Perhaps saying the 'pace of missile development' is not quite accurate wording, but the pace of testing has indeed been unprecedented under Kim Jong Un,' said Jean H. Lee. Lee is a former journalist who covered North Korea and now works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She said even failed tests are worrisome because North Korea is trying to create a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. 'With every test, they get closer to mastering that technology,' she said. We couldn't find any report from the Department of Defense that might vouch for Burr's numbers. But we did find a February speech by Admiral Harry Harris, the head of the DoD's Pacific Command. He spoke about North Korea's 'aggressive weapons test schedule' and a growing missile threat in the Pacific, which is in keeping with the general theme of Burr's claim. The North Korea experts we interviewed all said something like Lee's assessment: That Burr is correct to say Kim Jong Un put a greater focus on missiles, even if it's hard to define how much. 'The range of their missiles is being extended,' said T.J. Pempel, a University of California, Berkeley, political science professor who specializes in northeast Asia. 'They have substantial submarine launched missiles; they have ICBMs. The frequency and number of their tests is also going up.' Joseph Bermudez, an expert with the North Korea analysis group 38 North who has testified before Congress and the United Nations on the country's missiles, said Burr is right about the increased pace of testing. One of Bermudez's colleagues at 38 North put together a timeline of missile tests by North Korea, along with an assessment that nearly backs up Burr's point - at least about testing, if not about development. It said North Korea tested only one missile in 2006 (under Kim Jong Il) but tested 15 in 2014 (under Kim Jong Un). In 2016, the DoD's annual report to Congress made a similar point. 'Kim Jong Un seems to prioritize the development of new weapons systems, as demonstrated by his numerous appearances with military units and research and development organizations,' the report read. But Bermudez said Burr's not necessarily right to say an increase in testing equates to breakthroughs in development. Every missile program requires research and development, testing, training, tweaking and more testing. It's not a fluid timeline, Bermudez said. There are spikes in activity surrounded by relatively dormant periods. 'Now if you have multiple missile programs going on, these cycles overlap,' he said. '... It might give the false impression that something is happening that isn't happening.' Furthermore, he said, many North Korean missile tests are conducted for political reasons, intended to send a message instead of to further research and development. That's another factor making it difficult to tell if the pace of development has driven the increase in the pace of testing, as Burr had claimed.",,,,'The pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Priebus' claim is accurate, but needs some clarification, so for that reason we rate his statement Mostly True. Share the Facts Politifact 2 7 Politifact Rating: Mostly True Says Hillary Clinton 'is the one that labeled African-American youth as 'superpredators.'' Reince Priebus RNC Chairman In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, August 28, 2016 08/28/2016 Read More info","In response to Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a 'bigot' this week, GOP chairman Reince Priebus reminded people that Hillary Clinton once referred to African-American youth as 'superpredators.' Priebus took a swing at Hillary Clinton's past, telling NBC's Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that her actions say a lot about her, adding 'she's the one that labeled African-American youth as 'superpredators'.' Trump, who is looking to increase his appeal among African-American voters, made the same 'superpredator' claim days earlier on Twitter. It didn't take long to find what Trump and Priebus were referencing, but for this fact-check, we wanted to take a close look at the full context of Clinton's remark. 'Superpredators' in context The 'superpredators' line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed in to law. 'We're making some progress,' Clinton said. 'Much of it is related to the initiative called 'community policing.' Because we have finally gotten more police officers on the street. That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994.' Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison. The 'superpredator' remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later. 'But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs,' Hillary Clinton said in a C-SPAN video clip. 'Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators - no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel.' The full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way. However, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this year's election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology. One day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice. 'Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,' she said. Later in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clinton's use of the term 'superpredator,' Sanders responded, 'Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term.'",,,,Says Hillary Clinton 'is the one that labeled African-American youth as 'superpredators.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The United States doesn't have one of the world's lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus: No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India. Another measurement called the case-fatality rate, which Trump incorrectly referred to as the 'mortality rate,' doesn't place the United States at or near the bottom internationally. We rate the statement False.","President Donald Trump defended his performance in fighting the coronavirus during an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace, insisting that the mortality rate from COVID-19 in the United States is among the world's lowest. In the interview that aired July 19, Wallace and Trump were in the middle of a discussion about the coronavirus' impact. Wallace said that 'we have the seventh-highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.' Trump responded that 'when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.' When Wallace fact-checked that characterization, Trump doubled down: 'I heard we had the best mortality rate. Number one low mortality rate.' Trump is wrong. Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to an inquiry for this article. Comparing international mortality rates Scientists define 'mortality rate' as a measure of how frequently death occurs within a defined population. Data on this question is imperfect because of reporting inconsistencies between and even within countries. We turned to widely cited coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University to analyze Trump's assertion. Specifically, we looked at the university's calculations of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 in population, which is a standard measurement of mortality rate. First, we compared the United States with other nations that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus. To do this, we looked at all nations that have recorded at least 100,000 confirmed cases. The United States has the sixth-highest mortality rate using this metric, behind the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France. But 16 hard-hit nations had a lower mortality rate: Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran, Colombia, Germany, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Argentina, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. We also looked at how the United States compared with its peers among advanced industrialized nations. In this comparison, six countries had higher mortality rates than the United States: Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and France. But 15 countries had lower mortality rates than the United States: Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Finland, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. By neither comparison is Trump close to correct. Mortality rate is strongly related to the age distribution in a country, said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. 'The countries with the lowest mortality rates will probably end up being the ones with the younger population age structures,' she said. Another measurement When 'Fox News Sunday' aired the interview, Wallace said the White House had been referring to the 'case-fatality rate' rather than the mortality rate. (White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany handed Trump a paper chart citing 'case-fatality rate' during the interview.) The case-fatality rate is not the same as the mortality rate. The case-fatality rate shows how likely you are to die from the coronavirus if you are infected with it. The mortality rate shows how common it is to die of coronavirus in a particular population, such as a country. Trump's point about the U.S. is not more accurate when looking at the case-fatality rate compared with other countries. Nine countries have a higher case-fatality rate than the United States. One country, Peru, has an equal rate and 11 have a lower rate: Colombia, Chile, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Nichols said that the younger populations of many developing countries helps explain why their case-fatality rates are lower than that of the United States. (Infected patients who are younger and, often, healthier tend to die at lower rates from the coronavirus.) And when you compare the United States with its industrialized peers, seven countries have a lower case-fatality rate: Austria, Portugal, Norway, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Australia. Nichols said that the U.S ranks relatively low on this measure because, despite its problems rolling out testing, it still handles more tests per capita than most other comparable countries.",,,,'We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world' from COVID-19.,refuted,false,"<p>• Another measurement called the case-fatality rate, which Trump incorrectly referred to as the 'mortality rate,' also doesn't place the United States at or near the bottom internationally.</p>",politifact

A reverse-image search of photographs of the mosaics showed that the while the pictures had gone viral on Reddit in May 2021, with nearly 100,000 upvotes as of this writing, posts had been shared to Tumblr as early as July 2020. Screengrab/Reddit The ancient Greek city of Zeugma dates back to the third century and is located in the southeastern region of Turkey. Its name translates literally to 'bridge' or 'crossing' in ancient Greek, a name that was given to describe the city's location at a major ancient crossing point on the Euphrates River, according to the World Heritage Convention (WHC). As of this writing, the city is on the tentative list of world heritage sites due to its rich archaeological history and historical significance - and its unique mosaics. 'Zeugma mosaics are a unique collection of pictorial art reflecting private taste in a cosmopolitan city in the Hellenistic and Roman East. The figural mosaics include unique pictorial renderings of ancient literature and mythology,' wrote the WHC. Mosaics in the Roman houses date to the second and third centuries and depict scenes of Greek and Greco-Roman mythologies that reflect 'private taste in a cosmopolitan city.' The first scientific excavations of Zeugma began in 1987 and continue to this day. The mosaic in question was uncovered at the turn of the 21st century, between 2000 and 2003, according to a video shared to YouTube by the Ministry of Culture of Turkey. It can be viewed just after the 5:30 mark in the video below: In May 2000, the nearby Birecik Dam flooded the ruins where the photographed mosaics were located, prompting an emergency excavation of the ruins complete with 60 archaeologists, 200 workers, and $5 million, noted Turkish Archaeology News. 'Of particular concern was the removal of Zeugma's mosaics, some of the most extraordinary examples to survive from the ancient world. Soon the world's top restorers arrived from Italy to rescue them from the floodwaters,' wrote the Archaeological Institute of America. The photograph in question was originally shared on Instagram in July 2019 by archaeologist Ali Korkmaz, who wrote in a caption that it was taken after waves revealed the mosaic during the Zeugma rescue excavations in 2000. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ali Korkmaz (@alizeugma2006) Though the video did not offer a specific explanation of the Zeugma mosaic, it was shown during a restoration program targeted at conserving a more than 9,100-square-foot area of another mosaic.

There is no evidence that elections officials used Sharpies to invalidate ballots. We rate the statement False.","With Joe Biden edging closer to the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency, but with ballots in battleground states still being counted, President Donald Trump and his supporters made false charges of 'surprise ballot dumps' and outright voter fraud. It seemed no claim of efforts to deny Trump a second term was too far-fetched - even the notion that election workers, in plain view at polling sites, intentionally gave pens to Trump voters that would invalidate their ballots. The text of one image shared widely on Facebook on Nov. 4, the day after the election, stated: 'If you were forced to use a Sharpie to fill your ballot, call the number below for your state. That is voter fraud.' 'That is voter fraud' appeared in red lettering in the image. The image included a Sharpie pen and phone numbers identified as election hotlines for 15 states, primarily those that were battlegrounds for Trump and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. (The first number we tried, for Ohio, was for a Trump campaign office. Democrats have their own 'voter protection' hotlines, too.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Experts say it is rare but not impossible that filling in an oval with a Sharpie marker could cause a 'bleed-through' that would cause a voting machine to initially not read a ballot. But in some states, election officials prefer Sharpies because they lead to ballots being processed more smoothly. And there is no evidence election workers gave out Sharpies with the aim to invalidate ballots, or that any widespread spoiling of Sharpie-penned ballots occurred. Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he is 'not aware of cases where an election official said the Sharpie was fine and then the ballot was invalidated. Of course, every machine is different. But when the election officials themselves are saying this isn't a problem, I'm going to believe them.' Arizona's Sharpiegate As we found in a previous fact-check about Arizona, one version of the conspiracy theory is that Sharpies were foisted on Trump supporters because those markers wouldn't be read by election machines and those ballots would be invalidated. That's False. In Maricopa County, Ariz., home to metropolitan Phoenix, voters could use ink pens to fill out their ballots, but the county gave Sharpie markers to voters because ballots filled in with Sharpie pens are processed more precisely by voting machines. FactCheck.org, Lead Stories and other fact-checkers reached similar conclusions. So did the New York Times. A USA Today fact-check rated a similar claim in Michigan as false. Since then, the Arizona Attorney General's Office, saying it had received hundreds of complaints from residents, asked the Maricopa County Elections Department for information about the use of Sharpies and any instances of ballots being rejected because of bleed-throughs. But officials and experts have repeatedly knocked down #sharpiegate claims, which have been shared by the president's son, Eric Trump, among other Republicans. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted on Nov. 4: 'IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!' Here's what we know A letter dated Nov. 4 to voters from the Republican chairman and the only Democratic member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors explained why Sharpies were recommended and provided to voters. 'We did extensive testing on multiple different types of ink with our new vote tabulation equipment. Sharpies are recommended by the manufacturer because they provide the fastest-drying ink,' it said. 'The offset columns on ballots ensure that any bleed-through will not affect your vote.' The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's website addressed the Sharpie falsehood in a 'Rumor vs. Reality' column about the election. 'If a ballot has issues that impact its ability to be scanned, it can be hand counted or duplicated, or adjudicated by election officials, who use defined procedures such as chain of custody to ensure ballot secrecy and integrity,' the website states. The Election Integrity Partnership, whose members include Stanford University and the University of Washington, was tracking #sharpiegate as it emerged on social media platforms. It called bleed-throughs rare and easily remedied per state 'voter intent' laws. 'There is no evidence of a plot to disenfranchise voters by passing out Sharpies at polling stations,' the group wrote. Katina Granger, spokeswoman for Election Systems and Software, a voting system vendor, told PolitiFact: 'We recommend black pens but, to be clear, black felt-tip pens such as a Sharpie are fine as long as there's not heavy bleed-through. Bleed-through is only an issue if the ink should bleed through to an oval on the back of the ballot.

But it did present a dilemma for the would-be governor of the state of beer and brats. The question: Spotted Cow or Summer Shandy? The question forced Burke to choose between two well-known Wisconsin beer makers: New Glarus Brewing Co. and Chippewa Falls-based Leinenkugel's. She had to choose between a regional craft brewery and a much larger company. And between a slightly cloudy 'farmhouse ale' and a wheat beer mixed with lemonade. Burke didn't equivocate in her reply. 'Spotted Cow,' she said. 'New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and (it's) one of my favorites.' Wait, what? We didn't realize Spotted Cow was so exclusive. And when we asked some beer drinkers - journalists know a few - several seemed surprised that the brew wouldn't be available beyond the border. 'People love when politics and beer collide,' noted Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl. So we decided to set aside policy debates (it is late August, after all, and we are planning that Labor Day cookout...) and tap this claim. Is Spotted Cow available only in the Badger State? Breweries and their brews Spotted Cow is the most popular beer produced by New Glarus, the brewery founded in 1993 by Deb and Dan Carey in the village of the same name in south central Wisconsin. New Glarus has enjoyed rapid growth, including a $21 million expansion, and then another $11 million addition. But compared to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., New Glarus is tiny. Last year, New Glarus sold 146,000 barrels, making it the 17th largest craft brewery in the nation, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication. Leinenkugel sold almost seven times as much, 975,000 barrels. Also, Leinenkugel is a subsidiary of Chicago-based MillerCoors ,which has breweries in Milwaukee and other locations around the country. New Glarus is privately owned with 27 investors. More important, for Burke's claim, is where the suds are sold. New Glarus sold beer in Illinois for about six years before making a business decision to pull out in 2003. At the time, the Careys said they were unable to keep up with the demand and wanted to focus only on Wisconsin. In 2010, Deb Carey gave a little more colorful elaboration to the Madison Beer Review, a beer-oriented website. 'Brewers call Chicago a whores' market,' she said. Carey said New Glarus pulled out because 'it didn't want to participate in illegal business practices such as giving away beer to get bars to carry its products.' 'Everyone has a hand out and everyone wants some cash, (free) beer or a discount,' she said in the story. 'As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the graft and hassle.' She added: 'Small brewers can't afford to pay to play. I really blame the big domestic brewers for creating this mess.' In an interview, Carey said that even though the brewery has ramped up production and could reach 250,000 barrels a year, the sales strategy won't change. 'I'd be happy to die and not sell beer out of state,' she said. 'We're going to really drill down and focus on our No. 1 asset, which is (brewmaster) Dan, and make world class beer for our friends in Wisconsin.' New Glarus' website highlights the Wisconsin-only status with the prominent message: 'Only in Wisconsin.' Labels say: 'Drink Indigenous' Shepard says New Glarus' strategy is unique among small brewers. 'New Glarus is by far the biggest craft brewer available in a single state,' he said in an email. Shandy also a hit Introduced in 2007, Summer Shandy became a huge hit for Leinenkugel. Like Spotted Cow, it's the company's top seller. But it's a lot easier to find a bottle of Shandy. Leinie's brews are advertised nationally, including during the NCAA men's basketball tourney. They're found in all 50 states. New Glarus does virtually no advertising. Of course, you can find Spotted Cow in fridges around the country, thanks to visitors who snare a case on their way home from Wisconsin, or who use the online gift shop. So let's drain this one. Our rating Burke chose Spotted Cow as her beer of choice, saying she liked the beer and the fact it was available only in Wisconsin. The brewery made a business decision and stopped out-of-state sales about 11 years ago. And that's become an important, if not entirely well known, selling point for the brewery ever since.

The correct year is 2007.","During a 'getting to know you' Q&A with ABC News, Democrat Mary Burke fielded a question that hardly will change the course of Wisconsin's future. But it did present a dilemma for the would-be governor of the state of beer and brats. The question: Spotted Cow or Summer Shandy? The question forced Burke to choose between two well-known Wisconsin beer makers: New Glarus Brewing Co. and Chippewa Falls-based Leinenkugel's. She had to choose between a regional craft brewery and a much larger company. And between a slightly cloudy 'farmhouse ale' and a wheat beer mixed with lemonade. Burke didn't equivocate in her reply. 'Spotted Cow,' she said. 'New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and (it's) one of my favorites.' Wait, what? We didn't realize Spotted Cow was so exclusive. And when we asked some beer drinkers - journalists know a few - several seemed surprised that the brew wouldn't be available beyond the border. 'People love when politics and beer collide,' noted Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl. So we decided to set aside policy debates (it is late August, after all, and we are planning that Labor Day cookout...) and tap this claim. Is Spotted Cow available only in the Badger State? Breweries and their brews Spotted Cow is the most popular beer produced by New Glarus, the brewery founded in 1993 by Deb and Dan Carey in the village of the same name in south central Wisconsin. New Glarus has enjoyed rapid growth, including a $21 million expansion, and then another $11 million addition. But compared to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., New Glarus is tiny. Last year, New Glarus sold 146,000 barrels, making it the 17th largest craft brewery in the nation, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication. Leinenkugel sold almost seven times as much, 975,000 barrels. Also, Leinenkugel is a subsidiary of Chicago-based MillerCoors ,which has breweries in Milwaukee and other locations around the country. New Glarus is privately owned with 27 investors. More important, for Burke's claim, is where the suds are sold. New Glarus sold beer in Illinois for about six years before making a business decision to pull out in 2003. At the time, the Careys said they were unable to keep up with the demand and wanted to focus only on Wisconsin. In 2010, Deb Carey gave a little more colorful elaboration to the Madison Beer Review, a beer-oriented website. 'Brewers call Chicago a whores' market,' she said. Carey said New Glarus pulled out because 'it didn't want to participate in illegal business practices such as giving away beer to get bars to carry its products.' 'Everyone has a hand out and everyone wants some cash, (free) beer or a discount,' she said in the story. 'As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the graft and hassle.' She added: 'Small brewers can't afford to pay to play. I really blame the big domestic brewers for creating this mess.' In an interview, Carey said that even though the brewery has ramped up production and could reach 250,000 barrels a year, the sales strategy won't change. 'I'd be happy to die and not sell beer out of state,' she said. 'We're going to really drill down and focus on our No. 1 asset, which is (brewmaster) Dan, and make world class beer for our friends in Wisconsin.' New Glarus' website highlights the Wisconsin-only status with the prominent message: 'Only in Wisconsin.' Labels say: 'Drink Indigenous' Shepard says New Glarus' strategy is unique among small brewers. 'New Glarus is by far the biggest craft brewer available in a single state,' he said in an email. Shandy also a hit Introduced in 2007, Summer Shandy became a huge hit for Leinenkugel. Like Spotted Cow, it's the company's top seller. But it's a lot easier to find a bottle of Shandy. Leinie's brews are advertised nationally, including during the NCAA men's basketball tourney. They're found in all 50 states. New Glarus does virtually no advertising. Of course, you can find Spotted Cow in fridges around the country, thanks to visitors who snare a case on their way home from Wisconsin, or who use the online gift shop. So let's drain this one. Our rating Burke chose Spotted Cow as her beer of choice, saying she liked the beer and the fact it was available only in Wisconsin. The brewery made a business decision and stopped out-of-state sales about 11 years ago. And that's become an important, if not entirely well known, selling point for the brewery ever since. We rate her statement True. Correction: This item originally stated that Summer Shandy was introduced in 2011.

The audio first aired on Oct. 1, 2020, on the CNN primetime program 'Anderson Cooper 360.' Cooper referred to Wolkoff as her 'former best friend,' and The New York Times identified Wolkoff as being a 'close confidant.' The portion about Christmas runs from 4:35-6:03 in this video: (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) Melania Trump: They say I'm complicit, I'm the same like him, I support him. I don't say enough. I don't do enough. Stephanie Winston Wolkoff: Nope. It's, it - Trump: Where I am. I put - I'm working like a ass - my ass off at Christmas stuff that, you know, who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff and decoration, but I need to do it right? Wolkoff: Yeah, but - Trump: Correct? Wolkoff: 100%, you had no choice. Trump: And OK. And then I do it. And I said I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, oh, what about the children, that they were separated. Give me a fucking break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that? Wolkoff: I know. Trump: I cannot go. I was trying to get the kid reunited with the mom, I didn't have a chance, needs to go through the process and through the law. Wolkoff: But here's my thing, hear what you just said, but instead of that, if - you just - your messaging. You were so loved. You were. Trump: They will not do the story. We put it out. They would not do the story. Wolkoff: Until - Trump: You would not believe it. They would not do the story. Because they are not - they would not do the story because they are against us because they're liberal media. Yeah, if I go to Fox, they will do the story, I don't want to go to Fox. (END AUDIO CLIP) It is true that the first lady said the words: 'Who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff and decoration?' The quote appeared to be in the context of Melania Trump having wished she could concentrate on more important duties, including purportedly wishing to reunite a mother and child that may have been separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. At the time, the Trump administration was under scrutiny for its practice of separating families at that border with no clear plan for reuniting them. (More than two years later in October 2020, hundreds of such children had still not been reunited with their parents.) Wolkoff's audio recordings featured more of the first lady talking about her June 21, 2018, visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, in which she received quite a bit of press for a jacket she wore that read: 'I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?' Running from 2:44-4:34 in the same video from 'Anderson Cooper 360,' Trump mentioned her visit to see the children who came to America: (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) Trump: All these kids that I met, they were - they are here in the shelters because they were brought by it from through coyotes. The people who were trafficking. And that's why they put them in jail and the kids that they go in shelters and the way they take care of them. It's, you know, they even said the kids, they say, wow, I will have my own bed, I will sleep on the bed, I will have a cabinet for my clothes. It's so sad to hear it, but they have it. They didn't have that in their own countries. WOLKOFF: Right? Trump: They sleep on the floor. They are, you know - Wolkoff: There's nothing. Trump: - they are taking care nicely there. But, you know, yeah, they are not its parents, it's sad. But you when they come here alone, or with coyotes, or illegally, you know, you need to, you need to do something. Wolkoff: Right. Trump: And a lot of, you know, a lot of like moms and kids, they are teaching how to do it, they go over and they say like, oh, we will be killed by a gang member, we will be the - you know, we will be it's - so dangerous. So they allow to stay here. Do you understand what I mean? Wolkoff: I do. And they're the ones that are the bad ones. Trump: Yes, and they are not, you know, it's not true, that they would, you know, what, I mean, some of them, they using that lines that, you know, they're not professional, but they are, they are teached by other people what to say, to come over and to, you know, to let them go to stay here.

(Photo by BILLY FARRELL/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images) Melania Trump's reference to the idea that former President Barack Obama had a family separation policy is misleading, however. Family separation was not a federal requirement prior to the Trump administration. The Obama administration built cages that have housed children who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. However, photographs of the cages from his time in office depicted unaccompanied minors who crossed the border without parents or guardians, which is different from children being separated from their families by the United States government. Another claim that surfaced in 2020 about first lady Melania Trump and Christmas is that she purportedly said '2020 marks the final holiday season for the Trump White House.' This was false, however, as the website that promoted the misleading quote was not an official government website. Melania Trump's recorded conversation added a new chapter to what has been long referred to as 'The War on Christmas,' which has quite a long history.","Did Melania Trump Say 'Who Gives a F*ck about Christmas Stuff'?

Ronald Brownstein Journalist https://twitter.com/CNNNewsroomLA/status/955898432652115968 in a CNN interview Tuesday, January 23, 2018 2018-01-23 Read More info","In a discussion about the recent three-day government shutdown - due to lawmakers' disagreement over federal funding and policies for young immigrants in the country illegally, so-called Dreamers - pundit Ronald Brownstein said that while many Americans want Dreamers to stay, it's unclear if that can be achieved. Twice before, senators have agreed on immigration reform, but each time, the prospect fell through without action from the U.S. House of Representatives, said Brownstein, a senior political analyst for CNN. 'They probably can find 60 votes in the Senate to do that. They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013 for immigration reform. And each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up,' said Brownstein, who's also senior editor at The Atlantic. 'Without the president's leverage, without him leaning on House Republicans, you could easily see the same thing again.' The Dreamers are in limbo after the Trump administration rescinded a program that prevented their deportation. President Donald Trump has tweeted that 'nobody knows for sure' if a deal will be reached and that it must include funding for his border wall with Mexico. Is Brownstein right about the 2006 and 2013 immigration push? He's got his history right, and we thought it was worth reviewing in depth. May 2006: Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, 62-36 The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed in the Senate on May 25, 2006, along a 62-36 vote. The bill included provisions to strengthen border security with fencing, vehicle barriers, surveillance technology and more personnel; a new temporary worker visa category; and a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally if they met specific criteria. Then-President George W. Bush commended the Senate 'for passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform' and said he looked forward to working with both chambers. But the bill was never taken up by the House. The House in December 2005 passed a separate bill with greater focus on border security and enforcement, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. That proposal narrowed in on employment eligibility verification; immigration fraud; and immigration enforcement authority at state and local levels. It did not include a guest worker program or the legalization of immigrants. Instead of voting on the Senate bill, House Republican leaders held a series of summer 'field hearings' to get the public to weigh in on controversial provisions in the Senate bill, which Republicans labeled as amnesty. ''Our No. 1 priority is to secure the border,'' then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, said in June 2006. 'And right now I haven't heard a lot of pressure to have a path to citizenship.'' In September 2006, after meeting with Republican leaders, Hastert said they agreed 'that we cannot support totally' a lot of the provisions in the Senate bill, because it 'would not secure the border. Matter of fact, it erased the border.' Lawmakers from both chambers never formed a conference committee to iron out the details in both bills and the proposals expired at the end of the 109th Congress. June 2013: Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, 68-32 Backed by Democrats and 14 Republicans, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act passed the Senate on a 68-32 vote on June 27, 2013. The bill directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. It also included provisions to allow immigrants in the country illegally to adjust their immigration status, if they met certain criteria. 'The bipartisan bill that passed today was a compromise ... Today, the Senate did its job. It's now up to the House to do the same,' said then-President Barack Obama. But House Republicans again opposed the Senate immigration proposal, arguing that border security needed to be addressed first before legalizing the status of millions of immigrants. 'I've made it clear and I'll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill,' then-House Speaker John Boehner said July 2013. 'The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill.' He reiterated his position in November 2013: 'The idea that we're going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House,' Boehner said. 'And frankly, I'll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill.'",,,,"'They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013' for immigration legislation, and 'each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up.",supported,true,,politifact

As of late August 2016, Trump had not made his tax returns public, despite a decades-long tradition among politicians seeking office to do so.

Mission accomplished! pic.twitter.com/EYfUGIFl7j - Michael Moore (@MMFlint) August 28, 2016 Moore also posted a variation of the story to Facebook, alongside the same photograph of Maher apparently emerging from a Trump jet with a nondescript manila envelope in his hand: So sitting next to where the Mets play is LaGuardia Airport- and right there in full view of everyone is Trump's plane! Bill saw it last night when he landed there and posted on Instagram that he ran up the stairs and into Trump's jet and 'stole his peanuts.' A day later, the plane is still parked there! So we had an idea. I said,'Bill, you know he's probably been guarding those tax returns he doesn't want anyone to see with his life. He probably takes them with him wherever he goes! They're probably sitting on that plane right now!' So Bill runs up the steps and onto Trump's plane and re-emerges with...wait... Trump's tax returns! So easy! The stunt received some media coverage (as it involved two high-profile, politically involved entertainment figures) most of which consistently framed it as a joke. However, within days, social media users began believing that the claim was meant to be straightforward. Neither Moore nor Maher explained the mechanics of the bit (such as how they came to be on the steps of what looked like Trump's plane, or on a presumably secured LaGuardia runway), further advancing the idea the claim was genuine. The likeliest explanation for the photographs was that Maher and Moore were in the process of boarding a private plane that happened to be adjacent to a Trump jet, and Maher was simply photographed holding a plain folder on and next to the craft's steps. No part of the tweets suggested that the stunt was anything but a humorous take on the absence of Trump's tax returns, and neither Moore nor Maher has referenced the bit in any way since the 28 August 2016 tweets were published (as they certainly would have had they captured a major election year scoop). Even if the the scenario took place - presuming Maher boarded a Trump plane without permission with the intent of 'snatching' private documents - there was no plausible reason that Trump's personal papers would be stored on the jet, or that an aircraft transporting a high-profile presidential candidate would be unsecured on a relatively public runway.

John Lewis (D-Georgia), a hero of the civil rights movement who has suggested that Trump's presidency may not be legitimate, to 'a spoiled chimp that got too many bananas and rights': Collins continued, 'Bottom line, for better or worse, John Lewis is a man who's had a mediocre career in politics thanks to his alleged heroism in the 1960s. Well, let me tell you one thing - there have been a lot of people over the course of this country's history that have suffered worse things than beatings by police officers. We've had people who were tortured, mutilated, shot, slaughtered, decapitated - you name it and someone in this country has probably suffered it. And yet none of them are mentioned today, and none of them have had political careers built on the foundation of their alleged suffering. And that's exactly my point - John Lewis is a man who's been granted too many rights by white people out of fear of retribution. He didn't become a politician because he could contribute something; he was granted that status to shut him up.' 'And now, when things are finally coming out into the open, he's having a hard time accepting that his entire so-called career is a failure and that he and those like him lost to a superior politician,' he continued. 'To make matters worse - they lost to Donald Trump, who's not even a career politician to begin with. Ultimately, he can be as upset as he wants, but he's acting like nothing more than a child - no, scratch that - than a chimp that's lost one of his bananas and is now throwing a tantrum because of it. But, it's not his fault, let's clarify that; the problem is that chimps belong in a zoo and not the House of Representatives. At the end of the day, he shouldn't be upset - I guess Donald Trump is just too good at snatching bananas off of unsuspecting chimps,' Collins concluded. None of these blatantly racist remarks were actually uttered by Collins, however. The majority of the Politicops article is a 'satirical' (i.e., fabricated) spoof of statements Collins did make during a television interview in which he characterized Lewis as a 'spoiled child' who was only 'pouting' because Trump won the election: 'My opinion is, what John Lewis is doing, he's pouting,' Collins said during the morning broadcast.

But in the interview, Trump talked about how he won the popular vote 'in a true sense,' and made claims about 'tremendous cheating' in New York and California. The popular vote he is talking about refers to the general election, not the primary. There is no evidence of cheating in the 2016 general election. Trump made a ridiculous claim. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.","In a recent Fox News interview, host Laura Ingraham asked President Donald Trump what he would tell Republicans and conservatives in Democratic-leaning states about whether they should vote in November, and talked about whether a higher popular vote total would send a message of support for Trump. Trump interjected with a theory of his own. 'I think I did win the popular vote in a true sense,' he said. 'I think there was tremendous cheating in California, there was tremendous cheating in New York and other places.' Though he won the electoral college, Trump lost the popular vote nationwide, winning 62.99 million votes to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 65.85 million votes. In New York, Clinton won 4.56 million votes, while Trump won 2.82 million votes. We were curious about his claim of 'tremendous cheating in New York' in the last presidential election. We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign to get details of what Trump was talking about, but we did not receive a response. Primary problems Though we can't know for sure, New York has had some voting irregularities that Trump could have had in mind when he said that. In 2017, the New York City Board of Elections admitted to improperly removing voters from the rolls ahead of the 2016 Democratic primary. The admission followed a lawsuit, in which the city board was accused of violating federal and state election laws. According to a report from the New York City Campaign Finance Board, 126,000 voters were improperly removed before the primary, but were restored in time to vote in the general election. The report did not note anything that could be considered 'tremendous cheating' in the general election. A spokesman for the state Board of Elections said that Trump may have been referring to a recent story in the New York Post. Two days before Trump's interview with Ingraham, the Post published an interview with an unnamed Democratic operative who described the ways that mail-in votes can be manipulated. The story did not refer specifically to any actions taken in New York in the 2016 general election. The operative, who worked in New Jersey and mentored operatives in other states, including New York, said that tactics to manipulate an election result, such as knocking on voters' doors and asking residents to hand over their filled-out ballots so the operative can tamper with it later, have been used 'for decades.' The spokesman for the Board of Elections, John Conklin, said he could not confirm or deny any criminal activity by a political operative.

The claim was based on federal data. However, over the years, researchers concluded that the federal data was deeply flawed. While there might have been some undercounting, double and triple counting also took place. Most damaging of all, in the 1920s and 1930s, millions of acres of intentional fires in the southeast were counted as wildfires. One climate change skeptic called the government data 'a lie.' This year, the government withdrew its original dataset, and now only provides counts starting in 1983. There is no national level analysis going back to the turn of the last century, but an analysis of 11 western states suggests that the toll of fires today is at least on par with the fires in the first few decades. We rate this claim Mostly False.","The wildfire season in the U.S. has gotten longer. In recent decades, what once lasted four months has grown to six or even eight months. Climate change makes summers warmer, but past forest management has also left forests with more fuel to ignite. An article from the conservative Heartland Institute argues that the role of climate change is 'grossly overemphasized.' 'U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now - even in our worst years - than was the case in the early 20th century,' the Oct. 11 article said. The author points to U.S. government data that shows a dramatic drop in the number of acres burned, from over 40 million in 1930 down to 10 million around 2015. The problem is, federal officials have known for some time that their data was unreliable, and this year, they took most of it off their website (which drew accusations of cherry picking the numbers from the Heartland Institute). Many factors made the data shaky. Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story of bad data is that the government's old information includes millions of acres in the 1920s and 1930s that burned not by accident, but by intent. On top of that, there was also double counting, and, as some see it, undercounting. Explaining the data The Heartland Institute pointed to this chart to back up their claim about wildfire trends. The data came from the National Interagency Fire Center. A fact-sheet from the conservative Heartland Institute used this chart based on federal data. If you go to the federal center's wildfire page today, you will find this message: 'Prior to 1983, the federal wildland fire agencies did not track official wildfire data using current reporting processes. As a result, there is no official data prior to 1983 posted on this site.' A 2015 article from a Forest Service researcher explained why that data was unreliable. She wrote that multiple federal, state and local agencies filled out fire reports each in their own way, using different approaches to report different kinds of information. The article talked about records 'compromised by inherent reporting biases, inconsistencies and errors or uncertainty in the data.' There were instances when fires were counted twice, or more, said John Abatzoglou, a fire researcher at the University of California Merced. 'Some fires can be counted in triplicate as multiple agencies responding to the fire would count that fire in their summary statistics,' Abatzoglou said. The Heartland article author, senior fellow H. Sterling Burnett, minimized that concern. 'It's not that there isn't any overcounting,' Burnett said. 'But people managing federal agencies were smart enough to notice when two organizations reported the same fire.' As a record of the total number of acres burned over many years, historian Stephen Pyne, Arizona State University professor emeritus, said he thinks the government probably underestimated the damage. 'Most of the country outside federal lands was not counted at all,' Pyne said. The most certain conclusion about the government numbers behind the chart is that they can't be trusted. But many experts who have dug into the archives talk about a major flaw that greatly inflated the federal statistics. They describe how conflict between the U.S. Forest Service and southern landowners likely threw off the totals by millions of acres. 1920 to 1930: A heated dispute in the southeast In a 2018 article, Randal O'Toole, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, included that same chart showing the dramatic fall in wildfires based on federal data. O'Toole is skeptical of broad claims of climate change. But O'Toole offered this chart with a stinging caption. 'Some people use the data behind this chart to argue against anthropogenic climate change. The problem is that the data before about 1955 are a lie.' O'Toole noted that at the turn of the 20th century, Congress told the Forest Service to suppress fires. This mandate put the federal agency in direct conflict with landowners in the southeast. The Forest Service was steadfast in its opposition to all fires. But the southeaster landowners burned their forests every four or five years to control underbrush. 'Perhaps 20% of forests would be burned each year, compared with less than 1% of forests burned through actual wildfires,' O'Toole wrote. 'The Forest Service responded by counting all fires in that state, prescribed or wild, as wildfires.' There is broad agreement on this problem. 'The early U.S. Forest Service wildfire activity summaries do include millions of hectares of intentional burning on 'unprotected' lands, which, until approximately the mid-20th century was viewed by the U.S. Forest Service as akin to wildfire, as something that should be prevented and ultimately eradicated,' the Forest Service researcher wrote in that 2015 article. That wasn't exactly news. Researchers for an outside report commissioned by the Forest Service wrote in 2003 that 'in excess of 10 million acres were burned by wildfires annually' between 1930 and 1950. 'Most of the area burned during this period was in the Southeastern United States and were primarily incendiary fires,' the authors wrote. (Incendiary fires are intentional fires.) We raised these issues of the unreliability of the federal database with Heartland's Burnett. He said many articles in peer-reviewed journals had also relied on it. 'You can only go with the data you have,' Burnett said. He said even if the numbers are flawed, the number of acres lost to wildfires today is still less than it was in 1930. That's unlikely. Measuring fire in the West No expert we reached knew of any national study that could fix the errors in the government's original data. But there has been a lot of work done on the western states where the largest fires take place. Jeremy Littell with the Department of Interior Alaska Climate Science Center, along with several colleagues, examined fire reports for 11 western states - Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. They used a blend of federal, state and regional reports, and they filtered out intentional fires, only counting burns on federal or federally-protected land. They looked at the years 1916 to 2020 The peak of 7.4 million acres burned came in 2012. But the next highest, 6.7 million, came in 1919. Among the top 20 highest years, a bit more than half, 13, took place after 1987. The rest came before 1932. The fact is, there were some huge fires at the turn of the century. 'The large fire years in the West between about 1916 and the late 1930s were comparable to those in recent years,' Littell said. Littell said the triggers for large fires are the same today as they were in the first decades of the 1900s. Hot and dry summers in a preceding year lead to worse fire seasons. And since 1980, those conditions have become more common.",,,,'U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now - even in our worst years - than was the case in the early 20th century.,refuted,barely-true,<p>Flawed government data appears to show a massive decline in wildfires after 1930.</p>,politifact

Melania Trump speaks 5 languages fluently. - JD Sharp (@imjdsharp) April 1, 2021 The flag behind Biden was the UFW's official flag, which was designed in 1962 by Richard Chávez, César Chávez' younger brother. The flag depicts an eagle and was inspired by Aztec imagery. According to the UFW website: In 1962, Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta and others founded the National Farm Workers Association, later to become the United Farm Workers. That same year, Richard Chavez designed the UFW Eagle. Cesar told the story of the birth of the eagle. He asked Richard to design the flag, but Richard had problems making an eagle that he liked. Finally, he sketched one on a piece of brown wrapping paper. He then squared off the wing edges so that the eagle would be easier for union members to draw on the handmade red flags that would give courage to the farm workers with their own powerful symbol. Cesar made reference to the flag by stating, 'A symbol is an important thing. That is why we chose an Aztec eagle. It gives pride...When people see it they know it means dignity.' Since that time, the UFW Eagle Mark has become a highly recognizable icon in the union's boycott efforts, legislative, proposition campaigns, and a victorious symbol of its successful contract negotiations. A Smithsonian magazine article by Miriam Chawel, author of 'The Union of Their Dreams,' about the history of the farm workers' movement did point out that César Chávez had 'researched emblems, including cigarette boxes and Nazi flags, and concluded that the most potent color combination was red, black and white.' He then 'picked the eagle and directed his brother to draw the bird so simply that anyone could easily replicate the symbol.' However, another account in 1998's 'The Fight in the Fields' by Susan Ferriss and Ricardo Sandoval, which was a companion book to the PBS documentary of the same name, described a moment that indicated evoking Nazi imagery was not Richard Chávez' intention. The book describes how he came up with the design for the eagle and how César Chávez chose the colors, 'white for hope, black for the plight of the workers, and red for the sacrifice that would be required of them.' The book described the unveiling of their banner at the first National Farm Worker's Association (which would later become the UFW) conference: It was time to unveil the association's banner: a square-edged black eagle in a white circle against a red background. Manuel pulled a cord, tearing aside a sheet of paper that had been covering the flag-and gasps rippled through the crowd. Some people immediately left in protest because they thought the flag looked 'Communist.' Some thought the eagle design was inspired, half in jest, by the label on Gallo's cheapest wine, Thunderbird. To Richard's astonishment, still others thought the colors echoed that of the Nazi flag of the Third Reich. But experts have largely argued that the flag's purported association with the Nazi movement was ridiculous. Lauren Araiza, an associate professor at Denison University, told The Associated Press that in addition to red and black being eye-catching colors, the tone of red used in the flag was inexpensive for printers. Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, a professor of history at Fairfield University who specializes in the history of Nazi Germany, also told The Associated Press that the Nazi-inspiration claims were incorrect. 'One source of subtle confusion may be the fact that many Nazi flags featured an eagle with a swastika, the latter being a very geometric shape; the UFW flag also features a very geometrically rendered Aztec-style eagle that could evoke the geometric aspects of a swastika,' Rosenfeld said. 'But of course, there's no swastika on the UFW whatsoever.' In sum, César Chávez may have looked at the colors of the Nazi flag, among other emblems, while doing his research on the movement's banner.

6487,5308,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/high-income-earners-tax-rate/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 4 January 2019, the CBS television news magazine program 60 Minutes released an excerpt from an interview between freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and CNN host Anderson Cooper. In that excerpt, Ocasio-Cortez proposed that her ambitious environmental agenda known as the Green New Deal could be funded in part by higher tax rates on the super-wealthy, as reported by Politico: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is floating an income tax rate as high as 60 to 70 percent on the highest-earning Americans to combat carbon emissions ... Ocasio-Cortez pointed out that in a progressive tax rate system, not all income for a high earner is taxed at such a high rate. Rather, rates increase on each additional level of income, with dramatic increases on especially high earnings, such as $10 million. Anderson Cooper responded by proclaiming that such a notion was 'radical', a view held by many pundits as well. Others, such as Eric Levitz at New York Magazine made the case that Ocasio-Cortez's tax proposal would not have been radical in the past, as the tax rate on high-income earners before the Reagan administration was, in fact, 70%: In 1980, taxing incomes above $216,000 (or $658,213 in today's dollars) at 70 percent was considered a moderate, mainstream idea, even though wage inequality was much less severe, and supply-side economics had yet to be discredited. The highest federal income tax bracket in 1980, which included those households earning $215,400 or more, had a marginal tax rate of 70%. A marginal tax rate of 70% does not mean that, for example, a person earning $10 million would pay $7 million to the federal government for income taxes. The tax bracket system is progressive, so not all of an earner's income is taxed at the highest level, as explained by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: The federal income tax system is progressive, meaning that it imposes a higher average tax rate on higher-income people than on lower-income people. It achieves this by applying higher marginal tax rates to higher levels of income. For example, starting in 2018, the first portion of any taxpayer's taxable income is taxed at a 10 percent rate, the next portion is taxed at a 12 percent rate, and so on, up to a top marginal rate of 37 percent. The actual percentage of one's income paid in taxes, known as a person's effective tax rate, is also reduced through various exemptions, deductions, and assorted loopholes. In 1980, the average effective tax rate for highest-income ($200,000+) earners was just above 40%. By 2015, the average effective tax rate for the highest earners ($2 million+) was 27.5%. As noted by Vox, however, comparing earlier tax schemes to today's system is not a simple proposition: Historically, the United States used to have many more tax brackets, and the top marginal tax rates were extremely high. Under Eisenhower, the top earners paid a 91 percent marginal rate, falling to Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70 percent under Kennedy and Johnson, before falling to 50 percent after Ronald Reagan's first big tax cut, and then down to 38 percent after the 1986 tax reform. One big part of that story is that before 1986 the tax base was considerably narrower. Rich people used to have a lot more loopholes and deductions of which they could avail themselves. The 1986 law closed a lot of those loopholes, but [it] also cut the top rate. But another part of the story is that there used to be more tax brackets. Right now a single person earning $550,000 a year pays the same marginal rate as a person earning 10 or 50 times as much. Under the old tax code, the top rate reserved its top rate for the super-duper rich. When speaking specifically about the marginal tax rate for high-income earners, it is factual to state that the top marginal tax rate was 70% in 1980, before the nation's experiment with 'trickle-down economics' changed that system substantively.",Were High-Income Earners in U.S. Taxed at a 70% Rate in 1980?

35119,106365,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/jan/03/michael-moore/michael-moore-obamacare-sends-over-100-billion-ins/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling Moore said that in 2017, Obamacare will funnel over $100 billion to insurance companies. The analysts we contacted told us $95 billion would be a more accurate figure, so Moore overshoots a bit. He characterized Obamacare as a pro-insurance industry program, which might lead some people to think that insurers would pocket all of the money. That clearly won't happen because the companies will pay for care, and also because insurers might need to absorb a portion of about $11.4 billion in new taxes. What happens to the bottom line of insurance companies is somewhat uncertain. Some firms speak optimistically about turning a profit. Some analysts predict it will be a wash, with revenues and expenses cancelling each other out. All such assertions are based on predictions that could be on target or not. Here, we're focusing only on the specifics of Moore's claim -- which is largely accurate. We rate it Mostly True.","Michael Moore, the rough-edged populist maker of films about guns, the erosion of the middle class and capitalism itself, kicked off 2014 with some harsh words for President Barack Obama. In a New York Times op-ed, Moore called Obama's signature health care law 'awful.' 'The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go,' Moore said. 'By 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies.' We have consistently found that, contrary to the claims from the president's critics, the newly implemented law is not a government takeover of health care. Instead, it drops a layer of regulations and subsidies on top of the existing private sector system. While that generally supports Moore's contention that the government is sending lots of dollars in the direction of private insurance companies, we wanted to dig further into the specifics. Moore's staff directed us to a May 2013 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers who help Congress assess its choices. The money Moore has in mind represents the subsidies the federal government is offering to make health insurance more affordable for millions of people. Many individuals who purchase coverage through either the federal or a state marketplace, at prices set by insurers, will be eligible to receive tax credits that lower their premium costs. There are a couple of ways the money can make it to the private insurers that offer the plans. The government might transfer the funds directly to the company or the customer might pay and then get a tax credit at the end of the year. Regardless, each month the private insurance companies get their money. The $100 billion number Moore cited in the New York Times is off, but just slightly, said Josh Fangmeier, a health policy analyst at the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation at the University of Michigan. A more accurate figure from that CBO report is $95 billion in 2017. The subsidies, which have the effect of lowering premiums, 'will increase demand for coverage, and insurance companies will likely benefit from this by gaining more customers,' Fangmeier said. The CBO figures there will be 20 million people getting subsidies in 2017. That's a fair bit of new business for private insurers but Scott Harrington, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said no one should confuse revenues with profits. Most of the new money will pass through the insurance companies' hands. 'At least 80 percent of those dollars -- and probably more -- will go directly towards paying medical claims of enrollees,' Harrington said. Still, Harrington noted that there will also be new customers who buy without subsidies because the law requires all citizens to have insurance. 'There is no doubt that the law will increase insurers' revenues given that more people will be buying coverage,' he said. At least a couple of the largest insurance companies speak of the Affordable Care Act as an opportunity, not a threat. This past October, Joseph Swedish, the chief executive officer of Wellpoint, gave this upbeat summary. 'Today we are raising our 2013 membership and earnings per share guidance, reflecting our strong performance, our continued preparation and the outlook for coming market changes under the Affordable Care Act,' Swedish said. In a December press release, UnitedHealth Group touted government-sponsored programs as a significant source of growth. 'Approximately 25 million consumers are expected to purchase coverage through public exchanges (the online marketplaces) in the coming years. We are well positioned to meet both consumer and employer needs in the traditional, public exchange and private exchange marketplaces,' the company said. Both of these insurers emphasized that nothing is guaranteed and warned that the Affordable Care Act could cut into profits. UnitedHealth Group cautioned specifically about the next couple of years. But after that, their projections were positive. In one respect, the government takes back part of what it offers insurers. The overall plan raises billions in taxes and fees. In 2017, the government expects to collect about $11.4 billion from insurance companies. That could cut into profits but most analysts, including the CBO and America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, expect companies to pass those costs on to consumers. The health care law also phases out subsidies in place today that make the Medicare Advantage program more lucrative for insurers. At the end of the day, the extent to which insurance companies will profit is a matter of debate and uncertainty. Chris Conover, a health policy analyst at Duke University, does not believe the subsidies will add to the companies' bottom line once you factor in the cost of care. 'It's simply a pure pass-through operation on which insurers make zero profit,' Conover said. But Fangmeier pointed to work by the Urban Institute, which projected that for different age groups, sometimes premiums would tend to be higher than health care claims and sometimes they would be lower. Fangmeier said the companies could 'at least break even.' How it turns out will depend on who buys coverage, how much health care they use, and how efficiently the insurance companies operate. A final note: Both Fangmeier and Conover emphasized that the federal government already heavily subsidizes the health insurance industry through the unique tax rules for employer-sponsored coverage. The employer can take the share it pays of the premiums as a deduction, while the worker gets the benefit tax-free. In 2017, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that will cost the government $171 billion, much more than the subsidies paid through the Affordable Care Act. That is not the only difference. 'Unlike the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which is a progressive subsidy, the employer insurance tax exemption is regressive,' Fangmeier said. 'Meaning that the value of the subsidy to employees increases as their income level increases.'",,,,"Because of the health care law, 'by 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

RELATED: 4 people want to be Georgia's next 2 senators. The races could tip the Senate","Republicans for years have worked to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, the law that established the gold standard for protecting people with preexisting health conditions against discrimination in insurance pricing and coverage. Those efforts include a lawsuit - backed by the Trump administration and Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler - that would overturn Obamacare. The case is awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court. Now Loeffler, campaigning in one of two Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections that will determine which party controls the Senate, has advanced a new health care proposal - a 'framework' she claims will 'ensure Americans with preexisting conditions are protected.' Previous GOP alternatives, including one from Georgia's other senator, David Perdue, have fallen short of Obamacare's protections for people with prior health problems. Loeffler's thinly detailed plan does, too. 'There is nothing in the Loeffler plan that indicates she would support the policies necessary to protect Americans against insurer discrimination,' said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy and management, and of political science, at the University of North Carolina. 'The plan is short on details and substance, and long on political posturing.' RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs Loeffler's plan The existing Affordable Care Act was the first federal law to guarantee that people with health problems could buy their own insurance without paying more than healthier consumers. Through multiple provisions, it prevents insurance companies from excluding patients with preexisting conditions. The ACA says carriers 'may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion.' It backs that up with another section that says they 'may not establish rules for eligibility' based on health status, medical condition, claims experience or medical history. Another provision limits the premiums that can be charged to older policyholders. The Loeffler campaign did not provide us information to back up the senator's claim that her proposal would ensure these protections. Loeffler released her four-page 'Modernizing Americans' Health Care Plan' on Nov. 13. As reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it is a collection of more than one dozen new pieces of legislation sponsored or co-sponsored by Loeffler, along with three measures already signed into law. The health care experts we spoke with said the plan lacked so many details that they were forced to make assumptions about what it might or might not include. Joseph Antos, a health care scholar at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, said because Loeffler's plan does not mention repealing the ACA, 'the ACA's preexisting protections remain in place.' But Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, interpreted the plan differently. She said Loeffler's plan 'would make adequate, affordable insurance for people with problems far less accessible than it is under current law.' Blumberg and other experts pointed to two provisions in Loeffler's plan in saying that it would provide less protection than the ACA. One provision would 'establish Guaranteed Coverage Plans to help cover patients with preexisting conditions.' No details are provided, but guaranteed issue generally refers to requiring insurers to cover any applicant. Before the ACA, such guaranteed coverage was sometimes provided through high-risk pools - non-group health coverage offered by states to customers who couldn't otherwise obtain individual coverage. Such pools likely covered just a fraction of the people with preexisting conditions who lacked insurance, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, and they charged far more than what a typical person would pay in the non-group market. If the Guaranteed Coverage Plans provision in Loeffler's plan is a high-risk pool, Larry Levitt, KFF's executive vice president for health policy wrote, 'it could provide help' if it's adequately funded. But 'the history of high-risk pools is that benefits were limited and premiums were high.' Other experts also said Loeffler's proposal appears to be proposing high-risk pools. Health care consultant Robert Laszewski noted that Loeffler's proposal has a specific plan for those who want their preexisting conditions covered, whereas all individual plans in the ACA's exchanges cover preexisting conditions. Her Guaranteed Coverage Plans provision 'would seem to indicate she will have a plan that does not cover preexisting conditions, but then she will offer a special plan that will,' Laszewski said, alluding to high-risk plans that 'tended to offer very limited and very expensive coverage.' Another provision in Loeffler's plan would give low-income families with preexisting conditions a one-time federal tax credit toward Health Savings Account contributions. The fact that people with preexisting conditions would need separate plans 'sends a strong signal that they would no longer be guaranteed coverage or community rates in marketplace plans' as they are under the ACA, and 'it seems likely that these plans would work like the high-risk pool plans,' said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein, director of DePaul University's Health Law Institute.

On March 27, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), a $2.2 trillion economic relief package to assist Americans affected by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The bill's most publicized feature was that the federal government would be sending $1,200 checks to every adult with an adjusted annual gross income of less than $75,000. While negotiations over CARES were underway, social media posts contended that members of Congress - or, more specifically, '[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and the Democrats' - were attempting to sneak a $25 million pay raise for themselves into the bill: However, neither the bill as passed, nor any previous version of it, included a $25 million pay raise for members of Congress. That misperception appeared to arise from a portion of the bill labeled 'HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES' which set aside $25 million for 'Salaries and Expenses': HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Salaries And Expenses For an additional amount for 'Salaries and Expenses', $25,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2021, except that $5,000,000 shall remain available until expended, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, to be allocated in accordance with a spend plan submitted to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives by the Chief Administrative Officer and approved by such Committee: Provided, That such amount is designated by the Congress as being for an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. As Evan Hollander, a communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, explained, these funds were not allocated to provide pay increases to House members: 'The $25 million funding is to support the House's capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network,' he said. The allocation also provides money to cover the cost of paying the staff of the House Child Care Center, food service contracts, paying the House sergeant-at-arms. 'None of the funds will go to member salaries, which are paid directly from the Treasury pursuant to the Constitution,' Hollander verified. The 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits any law from raising (or lowering) the salaries of members of Congress until after the next national election has taken place, so the House could only raise the pay of representatives elected in the November 2020 election or later (which, naturally, could include current House members who successfully sought reelection).",Did the House Give Itself a $25M Raise in Coronavirus Aid Bill?

22360,11302,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sweden-consent-sex/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In late 2017 and early 2018, the #MeToo movement on social media-prompted by a series of sexual harassment and sexual assault scandals involving high-profile men-brought consent and sexual misconduct to the forefront of public debate. In this climate, Facebook posts in January 2018 falsely described proposed changes to the law around rape and sexual assault in Sweden. On 15 January 2018, the survivalist Facebook page Survive Our Collapse wrote: If you live in Sweden & want to bang you must now sign a sexual consent form first. The law will go into effect July 1st 2018. The page-which frequently posts anti-Muslim, xenophobic and anti-liberal content-also posted a link to a December 2017 Associated Press article that appeared in The Guardian, along with a photograph of the purported 'sex consent card.' The card reads: SEX CONSENT CARD I am having voluntary sex. I am not drunk or high. I am over 18. I am STD Free. Date: ________ Male sign: ________ Female sign: ________ Men, keep this in your wallet with a condom. With this card, do not accept an Article 15. Only give this card to your lawyer. Do not confess to the MPs or your boss. Demand a lawyer. A day earlier, the right-wing, pro-gun rights Facebook page Right News posted the same message with the same Guardian article, but without the photograph of the 'consent card.' And on 17 January, Jonathan Babine posted a screenshot of the Survive Our Collapse post to another Facebook group, garnering 15,000 shares within a week. The claim that Sweden is about to mandate sexual consent forms is false and a misrepresentation of a real proposal currently being debated in Sweden. The photograph of the 'sex consent card' posted by Survive Our Collapse is a hoax and is not in any way connected to the Swedish proposal. In December 2017, the Swedish government introduced a bill that would mean prosecutors charging someone with sexual assault or rape need only demonstrate the absence of explicit consent in advance of sexual contact, according to a Ministry of Justice statement. The Government proposes that the requirement of consent be the basis of the new legislation; to convict a perpetrator of rape it will no longer be required to establish that violence or threats were used, or that the victim's particularly vulnerable situation was exploited. Currently, Swedish law requires that prosecutors prove the involvement of physical coercion or threats of violence, in order to advance a conviction. The proposed law, which the government said would be enacted by July 2018, changes that. In a correction to their original story, the Associated Press clarified that the bill would not shift the burden of proof to an individual accused of sexual assault to provide evidence of explicit consent. Rather, prosecutors would have to provide evidence that no explicit consent was given. Furthermore, Sweden's Embassy in Germany took the step of publicly debunking German news reports claiming that the proposed changes would require written consent of the kind claimed in Survive Our Collapse's Facebook post. In a statement, the Embassy wrote: The presumption of innocence continues to apply, of course. Contrary to many media reports, it is not necessary to obtain written consent. In one sense, the proposed law would lower the bar for evidence required to get a sexual assault conviction, because prosecutors would no longer have to prove the involvement of physical force or threats of violence. However, it could also be difficult for prosecutors to prove the absence of explicit, prior consent. On 23 January 2018, Sweden's Legislative Council recommended against introducing the proposed changes, according to a Swedish Bar Association press release. The Lagrådet-a government agency composed of senior judges that gives non-binding recommendations on proposed legislation-said the consent law would allow for too much subjectivity on the part of judges, and therefore did not provide the 'predictability' required of a new law. Swedish governments often heed the advice of the legislative council, but the consent proposal is part of a raft of measures to toughen penalties for sexual assault and rape, and has been a long-standing policy goal for the coalition government of Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Löfven. The fate of the proposal remained undetermined, as of 26 January 2018. The photograph included in Survive Our Collapse's post is a hoax. The earliest example we could find was in a February 2015 post on the 'Gorgeous Active Duty Females - U.S.' Facebook page. The card was probably intended as a distasteful joke in response to a long-running sexual assault scandal within the United States military. The phrase 'do not accept an Article 15' is a reference to Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which allows an armed services member accused of a relatively minor offense to request a hearing overseen by their commanding officer (a practice known as 'non-judicial punishment') rather than more serious alternatives such as a court-martial. The phrase 'do not confess to the MPs' is a reference to 'military police' (MP) officers. ",Do People in Sweden Have to Sign a 'Consent Form' Before Having Sex?

Polling data from the Commonwealth Fund supports the claim. We rate the statement True.,"During a speech to support President Barack Obama's health care law, former President Bill Clinton offered a juicy bit of polling data about one of the law's provisions -- one that allows young Americans to remain on their parents' health insurance policies up to the age of 26. He said more young Republicans are on their parents' plans than young Democrats. Clinton, speaking at his presidential center in Little Rock, Ark., on Sept. 4, 2013, said the option to stay on a parent's policy up to age 26 is a key element of Obama's law, because it helps keep younger Americans covered. Some young people, presuming they won't ever get sick, might otherwise be tempted to skip purchasing insurance coverage altogether. Clinton went on to cite data from recent polling by the Commonwealth Fund showing that 'large numbers of young people aged 26 and younger have already enrolled in their parents' plans. And interestingly enough -- if I were you guys, I'd promote this, (saying) these Republicans are the personal responsibility party -- there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' plans than young Democrats.' The irony that young supporters of the GOP -- the party that has repeatedly tried to repeal or defund Obama's law -- are actually using this part of the law more than young Democrats are led to chuckles in the audience. We wondered: Is Clinton's tidbit correct? We turned to the Commonwealth Fund study in question. The fund is a 95-year-old group that aims to 'promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society's most vulnerable, including low-income people, the uninsured, minority Americans, young children, and elderly adults.' The fund is nonpartisan but generally seen as supportive of Obama's law. The fund conducted two polls of young Americans -- one taken in November 2011, the other taken in February and March 2013. Unlike traditional telephone polls, this survey uses Internet respondents drawn from a sample that, by design, closely mirrors the demographic patterns of the population at large. In 2013, the pollsters invited 3,530 adults aged 19 to 29 to complete the 2013 online questionnaire. More than half responded, producing a margin of sampling error of slightly more than 3 percentage points. Here's a summary of what the pollsters found in 2013 when they asked whether a survey participant age 19 to 25 had, in the past 12 months, opted to stay on or enroll in their parents' health plan: So, Clinton was right -- 63 percent of young Republicans, compared to only 45 percent of young Democrats had signed on to their parents' plan, something they couldn't have done without passage of Obama's law. Sara R. Collins, vice president of Affordable Health Insurance for the Commonwealth Fund, provided us with some additional details about the survey. The survey included 1,001 respondents between 19 and 25 who were asked whether they consider themselves Republican, Democrat or Independent. Twenty-eight percent of respondents, or 285 people, considered themselves Democrats, while 26 percent, or 259 people, self-identified as Republicans. Because the question Clinton cited only concerned a portion of the people polled, the answers come with a higher margin of error than the overall poll. Collins said the Commonwealth Fund did not determine a sampling error for this specific question but found the results 'statistically significant.' Put another way, the results are reliable. 'President Clinton's statement is accurate,' Collins said. 'The difference between young adults who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats enrolled on their parents' policies is statistically significant in the survey. A greater share of young adults who identify themselves as Republicans are estimated to have enrolled on their parents' plans than did young adults who identified themselves as Democrats.' For what it's worth, the partisan variation was more pronounced in 2013 than it was in 2011. That year, respondents of all three partisan affiliations had much closer rates of signing up for a parent's plan -- 50 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Independents.",,,,"According to a recent poll, 'there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' (health insurance) plans than young Democrats.",supported,true,,politifact

Not in Congress, but in state houses across the nation. That's not a new story in Georgia, which elected its first Republican governor since Reconstruction in 2002. A few years later, both chambers of the state Legislature had GOP majorities. Those majorities increased in the 2010 election cycle, and a half-dozen lawmakers elected as Democrats on Nov. 2 have fled to the GOP in the election's aftermath. But nationally, did Republicans actually pick up historic ground in state legislatures in last month's election as the National Review stated? PolitiFact Georgia checked with Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures and a guy who knows about as much about political shifts at the state level as anyone around. 'It's a much different landscape than it was prior to the election,' Storey said. The Colorado-based Storey said Republicans gained 691 state legislative seats in the November election. Nationwide, they now hold 3,928 seats to 3,366 for Democrats. 'It was definitely historic gains,' he said in a telephone interview. 'It's the most GOP [state] legislators since 1928.' Republicans had the momentum going into the election, he said, but some questioned whether the GOP could surpass its 1994 performance, when the GOP picked up 525 seats at the state level. They easily surpassed that number and saw the biggest party shift in legislative seats since 1966, Storey said. Some of the state pickups surprised even the experts. Minnesota, the same state that made Democrat Al Franken a U.S. senator in 2008, saw its Legislature taken over by the GOP. And the Michigan House of Representatives went Republican. The GOP tilt was even greater in the South, where state-level offices had been trending Republican for two decades. Still, when the election began, 14 legislative chambers in the South were controlled by Democrats and 14 by Republicans. When the dust cleared, 19 of the region's 28 chambers were controlled by Republicans. The 2010 election cycle in the South represents a 'historic tipping point,' Storey said. For the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP holds a majority of chambers and seats. The online journal Politico recently ran the headline 'Democratic South finally falls.' The change has been going on for some time, writer Jonathan Martin noted in the article. 'But what this year's elections, and the subsequent party switching, have made unambiguously clear is that the last ramparts have fallen and political realignment has finally taken hold in the South's last citadels of Democratic strength: the state houses,' Martin wrote. Democrats lost both chambers of the legislatures in Alabama and North Carolina. Democrats now control both legislative chambers in just two Southern states, Arkansas and Mississippi. The realignment of power in the state legislatures can have enormous consequences. State lawmakers soon will begin the process of redrawing political boundaries, a process known as redistricting that occurs every 10 years. The party in power will obviously try to draw those lines to benefit itself, so the GOP romp of 2010 could have some real staying power.

They agreed to define and strengthen the city's rules against that type of solicitation and set jail time of 30 and 90 days for repeat convictions. The plan followed an initial proposal, sponsored by Councilman Michael Julian Bond, that would have allowed up to 180 days in jail for a conviction. 'The sentence should act as a deterrent,' Bond, chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee and the ordinance sponsor, said in an article by the Atlanta Business Chronicle about the initial amendment, which the council approved Sept. 17 but the mayor vetoed. During the Sept. 17 council meeting, the Business Chronicle wrote that Bond cited statistics showing that almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses involved just 78 suspects, an indication that the same people were panhandling over and over. With so many arrests, we questioned whether such a small number of people could be responsible for all the offenses. What data did Bond use to make the statement, and was the recidivist claim truly indicative of Atlanta's aggressive panhandling problem? Bond made a similar claim in an August 9, 2012, guest column he penned for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. At that time, Bond wrote, '[S]ince last July, Atlanta police officers have made 279 aggressive panhandling arrests. Seventy-eight people were responsible for over 200 of these arrests - which mean some 75 percent of aggressive panhandling violations are due to less than 80 individuals.' Atlanta's new ordinance expands the definition of aggressive solicitation by prohibiting someone from continuing to ask for money after he or she has been told 'no.' It also prohibits touching during panhandling. A second conviction for aggressive panhandling requires the violator to serve a minimum of 30 days in jail; a third violation merits 90 days in jail. We checked with Bond's office about the source for its statistics. The numbers used in the statements were taken from two sources: the Atlanta Department of Corrections and the Municipal Court of Atlanta. Bond's staff narrowed the court data of arrests between 2005 and July 2012 for panhandling-related offenses. Using just arrests from July 2011 through July 2012, staff then hand-counted the offenses and repeat offenders. The challenge in evaluating the claim comes with Atlanta's current laws. As it stands, Atlanta does not have a specific aggressive panhandling ordinance. It does have a commercial solicitation ordinance, but no one has been arrested or prosecuted under it since it was passed in 2005. Instead, most aggressive panhandlers had been charged with begging/solicitation by accosting/force, according to police. For its analysis, Bond's office primarily used data on the begging/solicitation by accosting/force charge. Using that data does produce the statistics Bond cited. But because Bond did not specify in his statement which panhandling-related offenses he included, the analysis could change based on the data handler and the offenses selected. The court provided Bond's office with data about a half-dozen charges that could reflect solicitation or aggressive panhandling. Overall, Bond's analysis of the recidivist problem of aggressive panhandling is legitimate, according to experts who have studied the issue. 'These are the types of numbers that we are seeing,' said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, a community issue problem-solving think tank based at the University of Wisconsin Law School. His organization did a similar study of chronic nuisance offenders in Madison, Wis., and found the same phenomenon.

It's a relatively small number of people that are creating the most problems for police, local officials and passers-by.' So, is Atlanta Councilman Bond correct in his statement that 78 offenders were responsible for almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses? His assessment of the repeat offender aggressive panhandling problem appears accurate. But the varying charges that can make up panhandling-related offenses are not uniform and can change based on the situation.

She told a few of her staffers what happened, she said, but she didn't make a public complaint. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper days later, Flores said the incident left her 'shocked' and feeling 'powerless,' but she added that the action didn't amount to sexual assault. 'Never do I claim that this rises to the level of a sexual assault or anything of that nature,' Flores said. 'What I am saying is that it's completely inappropriate.' Another woman, Amy Lappos, said around the same time that Biden had touched her inappropriately during a 2009 fundraiser in Connecticut for Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat. 'It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head,' Lappos told the Hartford Courant. 'He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.' Two additional women, Caitlyn Caruso and D.J. Hill, shared similar experiences with the New York Times. Caruso said Biden placed his hand on her thigh and hugged her 'just a little bit too long' during an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Hill, a writer, said that Biden shifted his hand down her back and toward her waist while she and her husband were posing for a photo with him during a 2012 fundraiser in Minneapolis. When asked by CBS News' Tanya Rivero if the gesture struck her as sexual, Hill said, 'I can't say that that's the case. I would call it extremely uncomfortable.' Biden responded to Flores' allegations by saying he had offered 'countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort' during his many years as a public figure. 'And not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately,' he said. 'If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully,' Biden said. 'But it was never my intention.' The former vice president addressed the allegations again in a two-minute video statement released on Twitter after the other allegations emerged. He said he believes politics is about personal connections but pledged to be 'respectful of people's personal space.' 'Social norms have begun to change,' Biden said. 'They've shifted. And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what they're saying. I understand it. And I'll be much more mindful. That's my responsibility.' Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That's my responsibility and I will meet it. pic.twitter.com/Ya2mf5ODts- Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 3, 2019 Biden was later accused in March of sexual assault by Tara Reade, a former aide who worked for him when he was a U.S. senator.

And Harris, speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle in April, stood by the candidate who would later pick her as his running mate. 'I can only speak to the Joe Biden I know. He's been a lifelong fighter in terms of stopping violence against women,' Harris said, adding that Reade 'has a right to tell her story. And I believe that, and I believe Joe Biden believes that, too.' When the New York Times examined Reade's sexual assault allegation in April, its reporters spoke to seven women who had publicly complained about behavior from Biden that made them uncomfortable - including the four who spoke out before Harris' comment. The report said: 'No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade's allegation.

28718,103518,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/apr/30/tom-graves/backlog-veterans-benefits-draws-scrutiny/, ,0,0,,,We rate Graves' statement True.,"More than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan may have wound down, but policymakers warn the fight has just begun for some veterans. They say these warriors' newest foe is a homegrown threat: bureaucracy at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A backlog of disability claims has forced a growing number of veterans suffering from head trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments to wait for months and sometimes more than a year for word of whether the federal government will help them. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger called the backlog 'immoral' in a recent op-ed, and he used a stream of factoids to demonstrate how bad the problem has gotten. These figures piqued our interest: 'Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 ... pending claims for benefits with the VA have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration,' he said on ZPolitics, a website launched by talk radio host and former congressional candidate Martha Zoller. If Graves is correct, the number of pending claims has grown by more than 125 percent. Is this true? And was the agency's budget hike really this steep, despite the budget-cutting debates of recent years? We contacted Graves spokesman John Donnelly for more information. The congressman's criticism is part of a growing chorus of complaints that the VA takes too long to tell veterans whether they'll receive disability assistance. News stories have chronicled cases where veterans died as they waited for an answer. Lawmakers are clamoring for action, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has vowed to eliminate the backlog by 2015. Donnelly responded to PolitiFact Georgia's request for more information with the VA's own figures. First, let's look at the VA's budget. A 10-year overview published on its website showed that in fiscal year 2009, it totaled $97.7 billion. Now it's $140.3 billion. That's a 43.6 jump, or as Graves said, an increase of 'over 40 percent.' Now, let's consider disability claims. Although the controversy centers on backlogged claims -- defined as those pending more than 125 days -- Graves' statement concerns 'pending' claims, those awaiting a disability rating decision by the VA. Graves wants veterans to have to wait no more than 30 days for a decision. For this portion of our fact check, Donnelly referred us to the VA's weekly disability claims reports. On Jan. 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn into office, the department released a report that said the number of pending cases totaled 391,127. The April 8, 2013, report was the most recent one available when Graves submitted his op-ed to ZPolitics, Donnelly said. We found it reported 889,981 pending claims. Sure enough, Graves used accurate figures. But did he put them in the correct context? Although Graves did not accuse Obama of causing the growth in pending claims, he did mention that the increase took place under the president's watch. This suggests that the current administration bears at least some responsibility for the problem. We looked to see whether it does. We found that the backlog has been a long time coming. The benefits system had been outdated for years before Obama took office. When Shinseki, an Obama appointee, took over the department in 2009, it used paper files, not electronic ones. It did not have enough staff to handle the onslaught of veterans returning from a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'I don't think we really anticipated the nature of injuries, the multiple deployments. Men and women are surviving injuries that would have been sure death 20 or 25 years ago,' said Dave Autry, a spokesman with DAV, an organization that advocates for disabled American veterans. The VA hired more staff and in fiscal 2011 completed 1 million claims, a 6 percent increase from 2009, according to the Government Accountability Office. But the number of claims received grew 29 percent, the GAO reported. Veterans advocates told us that even though the VA increased staff, training fell short and claims administrators made bad decisions. Veterans appealed, and the backlog grew even larger. A computerized system intended to streamline the process is still being implemented. What's worse is that to prove they are disabled, veterans have to pull together documents from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense and other federal bureaucracies that do not share information, said Paul Rieckhoff, who heads Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which has been pushing for improvement. 'What you see is really a bureaucratic failure that stretches across the government,' Rieckhoff said. 'We don't think it's been a partisan issue.' In sum, Graves' numbers are correct. The VA's budget has increased by more than 40 percent, and the number of pending claims has skyrocketed from some 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama administration. Graves also was accurate in noting that the increase took place under the president's watch. While the VA's benefits system has been troubled since well before Obama took office, efforts during his administration have not prepared the department for its current challenges. We rate Graves' statement True.",,,,"'Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 ... pending claims for benefits with the (Department of Veterans Affairs) have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration.",supported,true,,politifact
19607,7819,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/vince-foster-avoid-testifying/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"No matter how many times conspiracy theories are disproved, they never die. Witness the return of a decades-old canard holding that Vince Foster, a longtime friend and associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, did not commit suicide in 1993 (contrary to the findings of multiple investigations), but instead was murdered by the Clintons 'because he knew too much.' Since the mid-1990s, Foster's name has held a place of prominence on the viral list of 'Clinton Body Bags,' a constantly growing roster of Clinton contacts who supposedly died under 'mysterious circumstances.' Like the theory that Foster didn't really kill himself, the rest of the 'Body Bags' list has been discredited time and time again. The Vince Foster theory persists because it has a partisan fan base. While campaigning for the presidency, Donald Trump lent it credence during a 2016 interview in which he called the circumstances of Foster's death 'very fishy,' the Washington Post reported: 'He had intimate knowledge of what was going on,' Trump said, speaking of Foster's relationship with the Clintons at the time. 'He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.' He added, 'I don't bring [Foster's death] up because I don't know enough to really discuss it. I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. I don't do that because I don't think it's fair.' The rumor cropped up in September 2018 in the form of a meme shared by two hyperpartisan Facebook pages, Uncle Sam's Misguided Children and Cold Dead Hands: The timing was curious. 'On this date in 1993,' the meme says, 'Vince Foster went to Fort Marcy Park and shot himself 3 times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton.' But Foster committed suicide in July of that year, not September. After some searching, we found that the meme had been previously posted on 20 July 2018, when that part of the claim, at least, would have been accurate. The decision to re-share it in September 2018 (assuming there was any thought behind it at all) may have had to do with the fact that the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had just run into a roadblock in the form of an accusation of sexual assault by a woman who said Kavanaugh groped her at a party in the 1980s. The most likely explanation for bringing up Foster would seem to be that it was meant to divert attention from a Trump-related scandal to a Clinton-related scandal, but there's a complication: Kavanaugh led the investigation of Vince Foster's death by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the mid-1990s, an investigation that confirmed (ironically, in this context) Foster's death was indeed a suicide. Kavanaugh has been condemned, on the one hand, for reopening an investigation that had already been concluded by a previous independent counsel, Robert Fiske, and 'tormenting' Foster's family (in the words of liberal pundit Paul Begala) on the basis of rumors that the Clintons were somehow involved in his death. But Kavanaugh's involvement has also given rise to a strange new addendum to the conspiracy theory in far-right circles, namely that in exonerating the Clintons he helped cover up wrongdoing on their part. Right-wing pundit Andrew Napolitano gave voice to this accusation during a Fox News Channel appearance: You remember Vince Foster who killed himself in the White House? How did his body get from the White House to Fort Marcy Park? Who was the prosecutor in charge of figuring out how his body got there? Who was the prosecutor that exonerated Hillary and the thugs that moved his body? A young Brett Kavanaugh. Whatever the motivation behind its re-sharing, the meme got almost everything wrong. What's true is that Foster killed himself in 1993 (although it was in July, not September), and that he did so in Fort Marcy Park in Virginia (not, contrary to Napolitano's claim, in the White House). But the sarcastic claim that he 'shot himself three times in the back of the head' (implying that it wasn't really a suicide) is a fabrication. Every investigation to date has found that he shot himself once, in the mouth, with his own handgun. The implication that his death was connected to an expectation of his giving testimony against the Clintons is equally false. Foster, who was a White House deputy counsel at the time, was distraught over accusations of malfeasance involving the White House Travel Office, and he had sought treatment for depression prior to his suicide. Foster consistently maintained that the Travel Office scandal was baseless. As the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler wrote: Yes, there is a fringe minority of people who will believe in just about every conspiracy theory. There are hacks who believe that Foster died in the White House and that his body was moved. There was even a member of Congress who fired bullets into a cantaloupe (or was it a watermelon?) in an effort to prove that Foster was killed. But there were also five official investigations into Foster's death, conducted by professional investigators, forensic experts, psychologists, doctors and independent prosecutors with unlimited resources. Yes, the bullet was never found. (Foster died in a wooded park.) Yes, the Clinton White House was sometimes slow to release information or took steps that at times raised suspicions, such as removing from Foster's office files concerning an Arkansas real estate deal. But that was all examined, dissected, discussed, investigated two decades ago - and found to be not material. The fifth probe lasted three years - and still found nothing.Recent Updates Correction [21 September 2018]: A previous version of this article erroneously stated that Fort Marcy Park is in Washington, D.C. and that Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault were classmates.

The warning circulated in screenshot form and appeared to originate with a local buy and sell Facebook group for Salem, Oregon. The misspelled post read as follows: We got are dogs these giant rawhides for exmas and are babies have been sick since Christmas Day we took them to the Vet this morning(thank you abiqua veteran clinic) we love the vet there btw.

And the manager said he had a bunch yesterday that they pulled the product and to come in and fill out paper work for insurance claim. One furry baby he said died yesterday from them......DON'T GIVE THE WALLMART RAWHIDE TO YOUR FUR BABIES..... According to the unnamed Facebook poster, their household's two dogs received holiday rawhide bones from Walmart as gifts on 25 December 2016 and subsequently fell ill. On 26 or 27 December 2016, the user stated that they visited a local veterinarian, and learned that the treats were 'laced' with formaldehyde. The post's author said during a call to Walmart, they were informed that at least six pet owners had called about the issue that day, that the product had been 'pulled' from stock, and that guests were invited to complete insurance claim-related paperwork relating to the purportedly contaminated product. In addition, the poster claimed the manager confided that at least one pet had died as a result. We contacted the Abiqua Animal Clinic, Walmart's corporate offices, and the Walmart closest to the post's location and veterinary clinic. The Walmart manager told us that there was no active recall involving Walmart's holiday rawhide bones, and while several people had called about the issue, the store was aware only of calls stemming from the Facebook post - not pet owners filing insurance claim paperwork. The manager told us that recalled products are frozen in Walmart's inventory system (making purchase at checkout impossible) and the holiday rawhide bones were available for purchase as of 28 December 2016. Another Walmart representative reiterated that no such recall or other action had been initiated involving any rawhide pet product sold by the chain. While the poster claimed multiple other pet owners endured the same experience, Walmart was aware only of the claims made on Facebook. Walmart told us that it made contact with the customer, but that individual was not able to substantiate any portion of the claim. ","Are Walmart Holiday Rawhide Bones Toxic to Dogs?

The word 'transgender' isn't mentioned in the guidelines until the 'Glossary' portion: At the Grade Five point in the table, 'Identify trusted adults to ask questions about gender identity and sexual orientation' appears as part of the sexual education curriculum standards, but no wording suggests that 'teaching transgenderism' is part of those guidelines.

The article didn't quite manage to connect the dots between the linked curriculum update and 'teaching transgenderism' to Kindergarten students, save for a reference to an expectation that Kindergarten students would 'understand there are many ways to express gender': By fall 2017 Washington state public schools will begin teaching gender expression to kindergarteners under newly-approved health education learning standards that designate sexual health a 'core idea' of public K-12 education ... While some aspects of sexual health aren't taught K-12 (HIV prevention begins in fourth grade), one component of sexual health titled 'Self-Identity' begins in kindergarten, where students will be expected to 'Understand there are many ways to express gender.' As part of an aspect of sexual health titled 'Healthy Relationships,' kindergarteners will learn to distinguish between 'safe and unwanted touch.' They will also learn to 'Recognize people have the right to refuse giving or receiving unwanted touch.' OSPI did not answer a question about whether this lesson plan amounts to teaching consent to kindergarteners. Subsequent portions of the article hinged on the selective quoting of responses from Nathan Olson, communications manager for Washington's Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) to Daily Caller. Olson was quoted only in part, and the precise wording of the questions posed to him was not provided by the Daily Caller: By third grade, students will be expected to 'Explain that gender roles can vary considerably' and 'Understand [the] importance of treating others with respect regarding gender identity,' as part of the 'Self-Identity' component of sexual health. Gender identity is defined by the state as 'Someone's inner sense of their gender.' 'The standards don't define 'gender spectrum.' But self-identity is a key component,' Olson said when asked whether learning that gender is a 'spectrum' is considered part of learning about 'gender identity.' We contacted Nathan Olson ourselves, and unlike the Daily Caller, we're reproducing his response in full rather than selectively editing it to support a preconceived bias: I'll start with the Daily Caller, headline. First, what does 'transgenderism' mean? We don't define that term in the standards; I've never seen the word before this article. Second, the headline itself is simply false: The 'state' doesn't 'teach' transgenderism. A simple reading of the standards shows that the state - because of state law - is responsible for establishing and periodically revising state learning standards. It's up to districts to adopt curricula, and it's up to teachers in schools to teach the material. Third, 'transgender' - let alone 'transgenderism' - only appears in the glossary; it doesn't appear in any of the standards or topics or outcomes. The mistake regarding what will be taught is repeated in the first sentence of the story. Districts decide which topics will be taught: A district can decide that its community norms don't include self-identity, and thus it won't be taught. He cannot know that every school will be teaching gender expression any more than I can know that. He's right that we didn't issue a press release. Typically we don't when we update standards. We did with the adoption of the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards. Those were special cases involving standards adopted by multiple states. In contrast, we didn't put out releases when we adopted arts standards in Spring 2011, nor when we adopted world language standards in Summer 2010.

We're dead last in the Midwest for job creation.' 'Dead last' just won't die. OK, we're game for another go at this.

The measurements are done every three months, but they also lag by many months. The quarterly figures have been called the gold standard because they are based on a census of 96 percent of the nation's employers in the public and private sectors.

Mary Burke relentlessly made dead-last claims while running against Gov. Scott Walker in the 2014 election. In checking two of them, which were made with some variation, we rated one True and the other False. Now comes U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. On March 10, 2015, the day after Walker signed legislation that bars private-sector workers from being required to pay union fees, Pocan appeared on a Wisconsin Public Radio talk show. Host Joy Cardin asked Pocan why he thinks the so-called right-to-work law 'is going to be bad for Wisconsin.' Pocan, who opposed the measure, began his reply by saying: 'Well, first of all, I think Governor Walker has taken us down the path of his presidential aspirations, and I feel that he is really ignoring the needs of Wisconsin. We're dead last in the Midwest for job creation.' 'Dead last' just won't die. OK, we're game for another go at this. So, four months after the election and with Walker positioning himself for a White House run in 2016, where does Wisconsin rank now?

23648,12932,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/only-two-cars-ohio-crashed-1895/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"One common claim that is often circulated on social media holds that there was a car accident in 1895 that involved the only two cars in the entire state of Ohio. We've been unable to find any documentation showing that such a crash occurred and the above-displayed photograph certainly wasn't taken in 1895. John Mohr, the Executive Director of the Society of Automotive Historians, told us that the cars in this picture were not available in 1895. Rather, these vehicles were likely manufactured decades later in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Mohr, a native of Ohio, told us that he had heard this rumor a number of times but that he had never seen any documentation to prove that this crash took place as described. The crash was possible, according to Mohr, as there were some privately owned automobiles in Ohio at the time, but as the state didn't start keeping track of registrations until 1908, it's impossible to tell how many cars were in operation in the state at the time. As private automobiles were quite novel at the time, it's likely that a car crash in 1895 would've made headlines. We found numerous news articles about automobile crashes in the late 1890s and early 1900s, but we're able to find any reports about the only two cars in Ohio crashing into one another. The World's First Car Crash While we've found no evidence to support this curious car crash claim, Ohio is home to a historically significant automobile accident. In 1891, the state saw what may have been the world's first car crash involving a gasoline powered vehicle. According to Ohio History Central, an Ohio history website run by the historical society Ohio History Connection, the first gas-powered automobile accident took place in 1891 and involved a single-cylinder gasoline automobile and a tree root. In 1891, James William Lambert was involved in the first automobile accident in American history. The accident occurred in Ohio City, Ohio. Lambert's vehicle, the first single-cylinder gasoline automobile, which was carrying Lambert and James Swoveland, hit a tree root, causing the car to careen out of control and smash into a hitching post. Injuries from this accident were minor. Lambert proceeded to patent over six hundred inventions, mostly affiliated with the automobile industry. An accident in Ireland preceded this crash by more than 20 years, but that crash involved a steam-powered vehicle. The Atlantic reported that an astronomer and naturalist named Mary Ward was the first person to be killed in an automobile accident when she was thrown from her cousin's vehicle and run over. In August 1869, Mary Ward took a badly needed holiday at her cousin's castle in the Irish midlands west of Dublin. Ward was an active naturalist and astronomer, working hard to carve out a place for herself in the overwhelmingly male world of Victorian science. She was also raising eight children more or less alone. She needed some rest, and when someone at the castle suggested taking her cousin's homemade automobile out for a spin, Ward went along. [...] In August 1869, when Ward visited her cousin's castle, someone suggested taking the steam mobile out for a spin, and Ward agreed. There's no record of who sat where, but four other people piled in as well. The party decided to circle the town green in Birr. According to one witness, the driver was 'traveling at an easy pace' as he approached the turnaround point near Saint Brendan's Church and rounded a corner. What happened next isn't clear. Perhaps a wheel hit a rock or a pothole. Perhaps homemade cars in 1869 just didn't run very smoothly. Regardless, the overcrowded carriage jolted during the turn, and Ward was bucked off. A second later, she hit the ground, and one of the huge iron wheels crushed her. Where Does This Story Come From? There's no evidence that the only two cars in the state of Ohio crashed into one another in 1895. So where does this story come from? The closest we could get to 'documentation' of this event comes from an advertisement for Mobile gasoline that was published in Life Magazine in 1967. That ad included a different photograph (one that we have not been able to find a source for) and a single sentence about this alleged 1895 car crash. This is not historical documentation of a car crash. It's entirely possible that this anecdote was invented simply as a jumping off point for Mobil to make a somewhat confusing point about car accidents. (The Swedes did not lower car accidents by deciding that 'life is sweet' and 'they want to live.' The ad refers to Dagen H, the day Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right. While this was viewed as a success at the time, car accidents returned to 'normal levels' in the years since the switch.) The claim that the only two cars in Ohio crashed into one another in 1895 is not supported by evidence. This anecdote appears to have originated with a 1967 advertisement and viral versions of this claim employ unrelated photographs of cars too modern for the time. Source: Associates, d'Oliveira &.

Gun dealers tell us the federal process is, in fact, usually very quick, barring some ambiguity with a person's record. However, some readers might take Langevin's statement to mean that the whole process takes 90 seconds. It actually requires a few minutes for the customer to fill out the paperwork and the dealer to transmit the information to the NICS system. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. (If you have a claim you'd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)","Imagine contacting the federal government and getting what you need in 90 seconds. U.S. Rep. James Langevin says that's how long it takes to get a federal background check if you're seeking to buy a firearm. The statement comes in a Dec. 3 news release, issued jointly with Rep. David Cicilline, calling for 'a more effective background check process' that includes mental health records that Rhode Island, under law, is prevented from giving to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). (A General Assembly commission is exploring whether to modify the law.) Langevin reports, 'The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires an individual to pass a background check through the NICS database before purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, a process that typically takes 90 seconds.' Why is the 90 seconds important to the gun control issue? Langevin spokeswoman Meg Fraser said it shows that 'running a background check is generally a quick process, and adding additional records to the system would not result in a significant change or inconvenience to the customer.' There are days when we can't get a cup of coffee at Starbucks in 90 seconds, so we wondered if the background check process is really that quick. We turned to people who use the system regularly. Robert Carney, owner of Post Road Guns on Plainfield Pike, in Cranston, said it's true that it usually takes 90 seconds or less for the NICS to search its database and determine whether a customer is eligible to purchase a weapon. And he does it with a phone call, not with a computer. The same is true for Adam Dacko, of Foster Bear Arms & Trading Post, in Foster. He estimated that 75 percent to 90 percent of the checks are completed within 45 seconds. Delays may occur if someone has a common name and doesn't provide a Social Security number, which is optional. 'It takes longer for me to read off the form than it does for me to get a response,' he said. Which brings up another point: That's not the whole process. Carney showed us Form 4473 from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which must be filled out first. It requires basic information such as height, weight and gender, along with questions about whether the would-be buyer is under indictment, has been convicted of a felony, has received a dishonorable discharge from the military, is addicted to any controlled substance, or is subject to a restraining order for harassing, stalking or threatening a child, 'intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner.' It took us just under three minutes to fill out the form's 27 questions and sign it. The seller must then confirm the buyer's identification, contact the NICS system, recite all the information on the form over the phone to an operator (or type it into the computer), and take down the confirmation information supplied through the NICS system. That would take a few more minutes. Gun dealer Robert Swinehart of Arquebus Co., in West Warwick, said the whole process typically takes about five minutes. Fraser then sent us a link to an FBI fact sheet about the NICS system, which claims that a 'response is typically provided within 30 seconds.' Swinehart said 30 seconds is typical for him when the buyer has a clean record. Although the local firearms dealers are required to keep the form on file, federal authorities are required to delete the personal details received during each NICS inquiry once the sale is approved. If a buyer wants to purchase another gun the next day, the would-be purchaser has to go through the process all over again. In addition to the federal check, local police are required to run a check as well, which can take a few days. It's all part of the state's seven-day waiting period.",,,,Passing a federal firearms 'background check through the NICS database . . . typically takes 90 seconds.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

14095,1129,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/flint-water-crisis-cps/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In January 2016, an event primarily dubbed the 'Flint water crisis' (involving lead contamination in the city's water supply at levels that posed a serious health danger) garnered national headlines. Although some details were murky as the situation unfolded, a number of items related to the crisis were circulated worldwide via social media. The undisputed core of the public health crisis was summed up by the New York Times' report that '[h]igh levels of lead had leached from pipes into the water supply' in Flint in a period beginning around April 2014: Among the items related to the water crisis that circulated online was a piece from the Free Thought Project titled 'Flint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Don't Pay for City's Poison Water': There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem. However, the city's government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can't drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment. Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills ... Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous. 'Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,' [attorney Trachelle] Young added ... Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government's responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill. The article confusingly vacillated between assertions supported by a largely undisputed chain of events (i.e., the water supply in Flint had been compromised for some time, and its effect on families was severe) with alarming but unsubstantiated claims (i.e., CPS was threatening to remove children affected by the crisis). The headline clearly stated that residents of Flint had been threatened with the intervention of Michigan's Children's Protective Services (CPS) agency if they refused to pay for water that was clearly not potable, but we were unable to locate any other account reporting on what would be an extraordinary scenario. The Free Thought Project excerpt reproduced above was the sole source for this otherwise uncited claim. A careful reading of the text suggests that the site perhaps extrapolated two unrelated factual items to form a third hypothetical conclusion: It was true the Flint water crisis was unresolved at the time the article was published, and that Michigan's Department of Health & Human Services' (MDHHS) list of possible red flags for child abuse or neglect allows the inference that a lack of running water in a home is grounds for investigation and removal of children. Page 15 of a publicly available document titled 'Mandated Reporters' Resource Guide' [PDF] further describes scenarios under which mandated reporters are obligated to contact CPS and file a report. Appendix 2, Section I (physical neglect), portion A pertains to neglect with respect to living conditions: under a list of items by which mandated reporters can observe potential conditions of neglect, 'running water in the home' is listed as a potential signifier. As such, the above-excerpted item quite possibly extrapolated its conclusion based on the existence of the Flint water crisis and demonstrated standards of child abuse and neglect evidenced by Michigan's documentation of those criteria. If so, the item made a significant leap between something that could conceivably happen (children's being removed from homes due to a lack of running water under normal circumstances) and something that might be far less likely to happen (CPS' tasking itself with imposing upon the crisis in the city of Flint by using its scant resources to target families and children already burdened by an ongoing and unprecedented contamination of Flint's water supply). We were unable to find any other reporting of such claims aside from ones citing The Free Thought Project, nor could we locate any independent, anecdotal reports claiming that CPS was removing children from homes 'without running water' in Flint. We contacted several divisions of MDHHS to determine whether there was any truth to the claim that CPS has removed children for reasons directly related to the Flint water crisis, or whether any such information or demands had been transmitted to families in Flint with respect to the water crisis. Under normal circumstances, the lack of running water in a home could certainly serve as grounds to initiate an investigation or even trigger removal of children from their home until basic living conditions are restored to the satisfaction of agencies tasked with ensuring children are safe from abusive or neglectful homes. Given widespread coverage of the Flint water crisis and its ongoing nature, the assertion doesn't make much plausible sense (nor does it seem likely CPS could have the manpower to engage in such a large undertaking). The existence of such a crisis in Flint and its effect on the city's residents are not in dispute and reasonably warrant alarm, but unsupported claims exacerbating concern and anxiety are not helpful to the residents of Flint or other people seeking credible information about the extent of an ongoing public health incident. In response to our inquiry, a representative from Michigan's Department of Health & Human Services confirmed children are not removed from homes solely due to a lack of running water (due to the current situation in Flint, or otherwise): We do not petition a court for removal solely because of lack of water. Instead CPS works to make sure the children have water - by having them apply for State Emergency Relief, or making sure they have access to water at a relatives' home or bottled water. On 26 January 2016, MDHHS Children's Services Agency provided us with a statement from executive director Steve Yager. Yager's statement confirmed no such complaints or removals occurred due to the Flint water crisis: MDHHS has not assigned a single Children's Protective Services complaint due to any issues related to Flint water. MDHHS works proactively to assist families whose water is shut off and to ensure families have water filters and bottled water in Flint. When a family is without water, our goal is to help that family provide clean water for their children. That can be through assisting families in applying for State Emergency Relief, setting up plans for children to access safe water at a relative's home or providing bottled water. We do not petition the court to remove a child solely for the lack of water in a family's home. We also contacted the author of the original The Free Thought Project article for additional information supporting the claim. He directed us to the above-quoted MDHHS guidelines, as well as the article's embedded RT video. In that clip, a Flint resident speculated that refusal to pay water bills could result in the eventual removal of children due to a lack of running water in the home: ",Flint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Don't Pay for City's Poison Water?

His statement correctly summarizes a recent study finding the state's death rate dropped by 3.2 percent among 20-64 year-olds. The decline was 2.9 percent greater than the average of a comparison group of 531 counties across the nation. But Marsden reaches a little when he says the results proved the health reforms 'saved lives.' Researchers believe that's the case, but caution they could not establish a 'cause and effect' between the lowered death rate and the health reforms. So Marsden's statement is accurate, but needs a little clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","State Sen. Dave Marsden says expanding Medicaid in Virginia will save lives. And he points to Massachusetts' experience as proof. 'When Massachusetts got health care, their mortality rate went down either 2.9 or 3.9 percent -- whatever -- but it saved lives,' Marsden, D-Fairfax, said during a June 18 radio interview. Marsden's comments, made on the John Fredericks Show, came amid fiery partisan debate over whether to expand Medicaid eligibility to as many as 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Uncle Sam would pay the entire tab through 2016 and 90 percent of added cost down the road. On June 12, the Republican-led General Assembly passed a two-year state budget designed to close Democratic routes toward expansion. We found Marsden's comment interesting and wondered whether whether the death rate in Massachusetts really did fall by at least 2.9 percent after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a health reform bill in 2006 that expanded Medicaid and mandated individual health care coverage. Brent McKenzie, Marsden's legislative assistant, said the statement was based on a study by the Harvard School of Public Health that was published in May 2014 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers examined the death rates in Massachusetts counties before and after the reforms were enacted, looking at the periods from 2001-2005 and 2007-2010. They concluded that the death rate per 100,000 people aged 20 to 64 dropped dropped 3.2 percent during the years after the reforms. The data was compared to statistics of people in the same age group from 531 counties in 46 states that had not undergone coverage expansions. The researchers concluded that the decline in Massachusetts was 2.9 percent greater than the average of the U.S. counties that had not expanded coverage. 'What we found in Massachusetts after reform was a significant reduction in deaths from the kinds of illnesses where we expect health care to have the biggest impact, including infections, cancer and cardiovascular disease,' Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy at Harvard and a report co-author, said in a news release announcing the results. The study also found the largest death rate drops occurred in Massachusetts counties that had low insurance coverage prior to the reforms. A key advantage of the Harvard study was its size -- examining an estimated 270,000 Massachusetts adults gained insurance through the reform. Although the study found a correlation between health care coverage and lower death rates, there's on-going debate over whether the reforms caused that result. The Harvard School of Public Health report estimated that state's mandatory insurance laws prevented about 320 deaths a year. But researchers cautioned that they couldn't definitively 'establish cause and effect' between the lowered death rate and the reforms. They also noted that the results in Massachusetts 'may not generalize to other states.' 'We find significant reduction in mortality among nonelderly adults in Massachusetts since its 2006 reform relative to a control group in counties of similar counties in states without such reforms,' the report says. 'Although this analysis cannot demonstrate causality, the results offer suggestive evidence that the Affordable Care Act -- modeled after the Massachusetts law -- may impact not only coverage and access but also mortality.' An article in the New York Times said health economists viewed the report as strong evidence that the Massachusetts' health care overhaul had saved lives, but noted experts also said the study 'will not settle the long-debated question on whether being insured prolongs life.' Some analysts quoted in The Times and in a Boston Globe article said the results add to a body of research showing health care coverage extends lives. But skeptics questioned whether the death rate drop found in the study would occur so quickly after the Massachusetts reforms took root. The Harvard report notes other studies have looked at the effect of health insurance on mortality and the results have been mixed. A 2012 report in the New England Journal of Medicine found that several states that expanded their Medicaid eligibility programs before Obamacare passed in 2010 saw 'significant decreases in mortality.' The researchers noted, however, that they 'cannot definitively show causality.' In contrast, a 2011 study of Medicaid expansion in Oregon did not find a link between health insurance and death rates. A 2013 follow-up study found that the state's Medicaid expansion led to better mental health and lower financial strain among beneficiaries, but researchers did not find improvement in important physical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.",,,,After Massachusetts passed a mandatory health insurance law 'their mortality rate went down...it saved lives.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The first volley came when incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill released an ad (embedded here) that challenged her Republican opponent, state attorney general Josh Hawley, over health care. In the ad, McCaskill discusses her own struggle with breast cancer and warns that a lawsuit Hawley has signed onto threatens provisions within the Affordable Care Act that enable people with pre-existing conditions to get health insurance. Then, on Sept. 19, Hawley's campaign took a portion of that ad and threw it back on McCaskill. The Hawley camp released a 15-second video that begins with McCaskill talking to the camera, saying, 'The insurance companies already have too many senators on their side.' A narrator responds: 'What a hypocrite. Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate.' We found the Hawley campaign has a point about McCaskill's support from insurers, but it requires some caveats so voters have the full picture. A look at the data The visual in the video showing McCaskill at No. 2 on the contribution list comes from this page in the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited money-in-politics resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics. It shows the top recipients of donations from the insurance sector among senators in the 2017-18 campaign cycle. By the time we looked at the OpenSecrets page, it had been updated with new data that pushed McCaskill down by one slot to third. We won't quibble with a third-place ranking as opposed to a second-place ranking; the underlying claim is that McCaskill ranks high among all senators. Some caveats However, a closer look at the methodology that went into creating the list in question brings up a couple of important points to note. • The OpenSecrets data for donations doesn't just include health insurers; it includes all insurers, including life, property and car insurance companies. The Hawley camp argues that the video uses McCaskill's exact language - 'the insurance companies' - and that she did not specify health insurance companies. However, we believe anyone who sees the first three-quarters of McCaskill's ad would clearly believe she was referring to health insurers, because that's what the entire ad is about. • Because the 2018 list represents a snapshot in time, it doesn't support the notion that McCaskill leads 'the entire Senate' in donations from the industry. Generally speaking, senators take in significantly more money from donors during the one-out-of-three election cycles in which they are up for reelection, as McCaskill is now. This essentially shrinks the pool of incumbents actively raising money for an election. Yes, there are 100 senators, but there are only 35 seats up for election this November, and 32 incumbents running. Why does that matter? Of the top 10 senators on the OpenSecrets list, all are up for re-election except one, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. In addition, McCaskill's contributions from insurance companies have varied depending on what time period you look at. If you look at the 2014 and 2016 campaign cycles, McCaskill didn't rank in the top 20 either time. Even in her prior reelection cycle, 2012, McCaskill ranked 19th among senators, and if you add in non-incumbents running for the Senate that cycle, she fell out of the top 20 entirely. Meanwhile, McCaskill's haul so far cycle - $295,338 - is a fraction of what four Republicans received in the 2016 cycle (Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania) and what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., received from the industry in the 2014 cycle. • Much of the money used to determine the 2018 rankings doesn't come from 'insurance companies.' Donors on the OpenSecrets list don't only include political action committees but also individual donors who have listed an employer. So a donation from a low-level employee or their spouse would count in this tally as coming from 'the industry.' Are there more revealing figures? If you look at related campaign-finance data, both sides can claim some vindication. When we asked the Center for Responsive Politics if they could drill down further to look only at health insurers' donations, they told us that from 2013 to 2018, McCaskill received a combined $413,528 from donors related to the 'accident and health insurers' category as well a separate category, health maintenance organizations. By contrast, Hawley, who was not a federal candidate for much of that time span, received just $5,400. On the other hand, if you look at the percentage of donations McCaskill received from the 'insurance category,' it's pretty modest. She has received $295,338 from all insurance sources in the 2018 campaign cycle, but she's raised in excess of $20 million from all sources as of this writing. So insurance-related donations account for just 1.4 percent of her contributions, casting doubt on Hawley's implication that she's controlled by the industry.",,,,Says 'Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Origins: While no doubt some animal shelters facing imminent closure due to desperate straits (financial or otherwise) have been forced into the extreme measure of euthanizing unadopted animals that could not be placed elsewhere, animal lovers can take heart in the knowledge that none of the shelters mentioned in the Internet-circulated appeals referenced in this article was ever in the position of closing for good, much less of having to euthanize all of its unadopted cats and dogs. One version of this item, spread by social media in September 2013, held that the Kern County Animal Shelter in Bakersfield, California, had lost the lease on its current location and would be shutting down on the last day of that month and potentially putting down over 900 animals not adopted by that date. However, the facility's director went public to disclaim the rumor, announcing at a 6 September 2013 news conference that although the shelter would be moving to a new location, all the animals currently in its care would continue to be cared for in the meanwhile and none would be euthanized: The county will be forced to move out of the city's shelter on Mt. Vernon [Avenue] by the end of the month.The county addressed what they plan to do with the animals in a news conference to end all social media rumors. In the conference, the director of the animal shelter emphasized that no animals will be put down because of the eviction. The director said the county plans 'to continue to care for all animals' and they will continue to work with all animal rescue groups. According to the director, the county will move all the animals that aren't adopted by the end of the month to their new location. The first appeal of this type which we encountered was spread in early 2007 about the Orange County Humane Society animal shelter on Newland Avenue in Huntington Beach, California. The dire warning spread via e-mail was exaggerated: The owner of the shelter and the adjacent AAA Animal Hospital was about to begin a large remodeling project at the Newland Avenue site to build a new facility, but both operations were scheduled to remain open throughout the construction period. Although the shelter's capacity would be diminished during that time, any animals that could not be accommodated were to be relocated to other shelters. As the Orange County Register reported about the shelter closure rumor: Owner Dr. Samir Botros responded to rumors that his animal shelter was being shut down and that the animals not adopted would be euthanized.'I don't think we'll even turn away any animals' during construction, said Botros, who noted that he runs a no-kill facility. The shelter, which has been open on Newland Avenue for about 28 years, and the adjacent AAA Animal Hospital are scheduled to begin a massive remodel, said Botros, who owns both businesses. The shelter will remain open during construction, but its capacity will be slashed to about 60 percent or 70 percent. There are now up to 64 cages for dogs at the shelter and a large room to accommodate cats, Botros said. Shelter officials already have signed contracts with other area shelters and rescue groups to take animals that can't be accommodated during the remodel, which should take six to eight months, Botros said. He also said he believes the facility won't have to turn away pets given up by their owners. The claim that the shelter was ''selling' the dogs for 50% off to move them out' referred to a special program the shelter enacted for the 2006 holiday season which was no longer in effect. Similarly, in September 2009 appeals circulated via Facebook about a shelter in New Jersey that was about to close and would be euthanizing any unadopted animals: MONTGOMERY ANIMAL SHELTER IS CLOSING TOMORROW (new brunswick, NJ). you can adopt for free tomorrow between 12 and 4pm. tragically, they will be euthanizing all animals without a home.Montgomery Animal Shelter: 908-359-4308 This message was wrong on two fronts: The Montgomery Animal Shelter referred to was not in New Jersey (or Pennsylvania, or Tennessee, or Maryland), but in Montgomery County, Texas. And although the Humane Society of Montgomery County in Texas had to move out of its shelter building because its contract expired, its press release of 21 September 2009 notes that all its animals were adopted before it closed its doors:Th The Humane Society of Montgomery County wants to thank the volunteers, donors, employees, rescue groups and most importantly the hundreds of people who showed up during the past week to ensure all the adoptable animals in HSMC's care found new forever homes. 'We could not be happier with how well the public responded to our call for homes for our cats and dogs,' said HSMC President Kathy Scoles.On Saturday when HSMC opened its doors for the final adoptions, there was such a huge turnout and the animals were adopted very quickly. We had to turn people away and refer them to other rescue groups and shelters. In August 2010, word began circulating via Facebook and Craigslist postings that the Summit County, Ohio, animal shelter would soon be moving to a new facility, with all unadopted pets remaining at the time of the move to be euthanized. The Akron Beacon Journal reported that this rumor was also false: Authorities say Internet rumors that Summit County Animal Control is planning a mass kill of animals at the shelter are not true.Dogs and cats that have not found homes by the Aug. 21 [2010] move will be cared for and transported to the new facility by people trained to help animals in emergencies. Personnel from County Animal Rescue and Evacuation (CARE), in cooperation with the Summit County Red Cross and the Summit County Emergency Management Agency, have volunteered to assist with the move [Craig Stanley, director of administrative services, said]. Rumors that dogs and cats that remain at the shelter when it moves to its new $2.96 million facility would be killed began circulating shortly after more than 200 dogs and cats found homes at an adopt-athon sponsored by the Summit County Animal Coalition. After the adopt-athon, cages at the shelter were virtually empty, with 98 dogs and more than 100 cats having found homes. By [the next week, only] about 25 or 30 dogs and puppies and about 60 cats and kittens [were] left at the pound, [Stanley] said.",Shelter Closure Is an animal shelter closing for good and euthanizing all its animals that are not adopted before its closure?

He is correct: Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution authorizes pay for members of Congress 'ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.' Members can ask the House to withhold their pay, but that's just a temporary symbolic move -- particularly since they aren't scheduled to get a paycheck until the end of the month. We rate this claim True.","You know those members of Congress who are responsible for the federal government shutdown? While staffers have been furloughed, their bosses continue to collect their paychecks. During an Oct. 2 interview on CNN, Wolf Blitzer asked U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, 'Will you accept your paycheck as 800,000 other federal workers are being denied theirs?' Diaz-Balart replied that he hopes staffers get repaid when the shutdown is over. As for his own paycheck, Diaz-Balart didn't say he would or wouldn't accept his paycheck. Instead, he said this: 'There is a bit of a constitutional issue by the way, as you know, when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of Congress.' A few days later, Diaz-Balart voted to give back pay to furloughed federal workers. The measure passed unanimously in the House, 407 to 0. Still, we were intrigued by his comments that pay for legislators raises constitutional issues. What does the Constitution tell us about congressional paychecks amid a shutdown? What the Constitution says About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed during the shutdown that started Oct. 1. During past shutdowns, furloughed workers received back pay once the shutdown was over. Other workers have been deemed essential (or in government-speak 'excepted') and must work for now while getting paid when the shutdown ends. Finally, President Barack Obama signed a law to allow active military and the civilians and contractors who support them to get paid during the shutdown. But the rules that apply to federal workers don't apply to members of Congress. Most members earn $174,000 a year, with leadership getting a little more. 'Due to their constitutional responsibilities and a permanent appropriation for congressional pay, members of Congress are not subject to furlough,' states a September report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution authorizes pay for members of Congress. 'The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States,' it states. Most of the experts we interviewed and news articles we read agreed that according to the Constitution, Congress continues to get paid, even during a shutdown. The purpose of the language about congressional pay 'was to resolve the once-hot dispute over whether the elected representatives to the new federal government would be paid by the states or out of the federal treasury,' said Ilya Shapiro, Senior Fellow in Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute. 'So yes, Congress can't reduce/eliminate its own pay during a shutdown. I guess that makes congressmen and senators the primo 'essential' federal workers.' But we'll offer one counterargument by University of Miami constitutional law professor Stephen Schnably. If people are saying the Constitution 'is a barrier to their pay being withheld during the shutdown, I'd have to say the text doesn't necessarily support that. It doesn't say, 'regardless of any appropriation requirement.' ' However, 'what really counts in this area is Congress's practice over the years,' Schnably said. 'Mostly these provisions have been left to Congress to interpret.' Right now, Congress is scheduled to be paid. 'Constitutionally, we have to disperse their pay, but we are honoring member requests to hold on to their pay until after the shutdown,' said Dan Weiser, communications director for the House's Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. At least 125 members have said that they will refuse their paycheck or donate it, according to the Washington Post, though some observers say that's just a publicity stunt. And it might be a moot point because members get paid at the end of the month and it's possible the shutdown will be over before then. (Diaz-Balart's chief of staff declined to discuss with PolitiFact if Diaz-Balart wants to forgo his pay but when questioned about it on CNN he said that lawmakers need to avoid 'gimmicks.') One final wrinkle about their paychecks: Congress can't change its own pay until after an election happens. The 27th Amendment, adopted in 1992, states, 'No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.' That amendment means Congress can't vote to stop it's pay right now, said Kermit Roosevelt, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania's law school. However, Congress could pass a law for future shutdowns, saying they won't be paid, he said. Past efforts to do that have failed, though. In January, U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Bob Casey, D-Pa., introduced a bill that would would prevent Congress and the president from being paid during a shutdown or default. The Senate passed such a bill in 2011, but the House didn't act. Similar efforts this fall leading up to the shutdown also failed.",,,,There is 'a constitutional issue' that affects 'the paychecks of members of Congress' during a shutdown.,supported,true,,politifact

I've gotten used to being bashed, but a person can only take so much. In case it isn't clear already: no, I am not HIV positive. I get laid way less often than you'd think. The closest thing to intimacy in my life right now is when my roommate is washing her sheets and sleeps in my bed with me. Of course, having an HIV-positive status does not directly correlate with how often one has sex - to contract HIV, one only need have sex with one other infected person. It is impossible to know the HIV status of a celebrity. However, there is no proof that this viral rumor is true. ",Was Mia Khalifa Diagnosed with HIV?

Then the Etch A Sketch remark happened. On March 21, 2012, Mitt Romney's senior communications director, Eric Fehrnstrom, gave an interview on CNN about the strategy for the general election. Fehrnstrom was asked why Romney's opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, haven't endorsed him yet and how their far-right pressure on Romney will resonate with independent voters. 'It's fair to say that John McCain was considerably a more moderate candidate than the ones that Gov. Romney faces now,' said political comedian John Fugelsang. 'Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election?' Fehrnstrom answered, 'Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again.' As expected, Romney's opponents pounced. Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial children's toy as props at campaign appearances. Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line, which provided an almost too-easy inroad to raising questions -- again -- about Romney's firmness on issues. Here we'll check one such ad, put out by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, which suggests that Romney has flip-flopped on abortion. First, the toy In case you skipped childhood, we'll tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch. First manufactured in the 1950s, the Etch A Sketch is a flat tablet with a red frame, gray face and two white knobs for drawing -- like an iPad from the paleolithic period. The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as they're turned, and those with superior hand-eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines. For most Etch A Sketchers, though, a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece. The feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability. When you're done drawing, you flip it over and shake it up. Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen, and Voila! You once again have a blank canvas. Now, the ad The ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. In the ad, released the same day as Fehrnstrom's comment, a clip of his interview plays, including the Etch A Sketch comment. Then the toy appears, with the words 'Romney on the issues' above it. Music that sounds like it's coming from a jack-in-the-box plays in the background. The first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen: 'I support a woman's right to choose.' Then the Etch A Sketch shakes, the words vanish and the next quote appears. 'I believe strongly in protecting life.' The ad goes on to portray Romney's apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan. (PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before. See our checks here on the NRA and here on Reagan.) For this fact-check, we'll see if the two abortion quotes are accurate. We found a Boston Globe story from May, 1994, when Romney was in a primary battle for U.S. Senate. At the time, he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by Roe v. Wade. But even then, opponents accused him of being a pro-choice pretender. Following a debate with opponent John Lakian, Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts' state treasurer Joe Malone, an abortion opponent. Lakian had said Malone backed him 'to reward the pro-life contingent that was very much in Mitt's camp at the convention,' according to the Globe. Romney responded: 'The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because he's pro-life despite the fact that I support a woman's right to choose doesn't follow very well.' That's the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridge's ad verbatim. Numerous other statements he's made, however, express the same sentiment. For one, in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, 'I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.' And, 'I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.' For another, in his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, 'I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.' The second Romney quote in American Bridge's ad reflects his changed stance on the issue. 'I believe strongly in protecting life,' the ad says. We could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words. American Bridge's spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes 'were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen. We ensured they were airtight, accurate portrayals of his positions, both past and present.' It's well-documented that Romney's past and present positions on abortion differ from each other. In a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review Romney laid out his views: 'I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.' 'I believe people understand that I'm firmly pro-life,' he said in a debate that same month. In October 2011 he told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Fox News, 'I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed.' Finally, we have examined Romney's shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation. In each case, we rated the charge True. (Please see our source list.) Our ruling American Bridge's ad suggests that Romney has been both an abortion rights supporter and an opponent. Using statements on an Etch A Sketch screen, the ad first portrays Romney as supporting abortion rights, then as opposing them. In other words, a flip flop. The quotes in the ad accurately portray Romney's past and present stances, but the punctuation suggests they are his actual words. The second statement was not a literal quote, and that's worth noting, but it was a true reflection of Romney's position. According to our Truth-O-Meter, this ad passes muster. It's accurate and doesn't leave out anything important. We rate it True.

Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever. So we wondered about the Walmart claim. Wealth, not income In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a 'defining challenge of our time.' The pope said that while the earnings of a minority 'are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.' Walmart, of course, is a big target. According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies. But let's be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they're not the same. Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person's assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income. One more point before we get to the wealth figures. Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares. Group's evidence Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group's claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier. (Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.) As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families.

We rated that Mostly True. That item examined an April 2017 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which detailed the federal funds Wisconsin could have received if the state did a full Medicaid expansion in April 2014. Under that expansion, anyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level would have been eligible for Medicaid. Wisconsin would have gained enough additional federal funding to reduce state spending an estimated $1.07 billion on Medicaid from 2014 to 2019, according to the fiscal bureau memo. But since that period has not yet ended, the state has not yet missed out on the full $1 billion. With seven months remaining in the 2018-'19 fiscal year, about $114 million of that has not yet been 'lost,' said Jon Dyck, supervising analyst at the fiscal bureau. He noted, though, that it's not really possible to 'un-lose' that money at this point since the state would be unlikely to reverse that policy by the end of the fiscal year. Walker, who has criticized the full expansion as essentially a new form of welfare, did institute a partial Medicaid expansion, so for the first time everyone in Wisconsin living below the federal poverty level was eligible for Medicaid. (As an aside, we should note the Medicaid coverage limit in various publications is reported as 133 percent or 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The official limit is 133 percent, but there is a 5 percent 'disregard,' which means the functional limit is 138 percent, so that is how we're referring to it.) Featured Fact-check Bloggers stated on November 16, 2021 in a video Athletes are collapsing with heart-related issues due to the COVID-19 vaccines By Kayla Steinberg • December 1, 2021 Medicaid move decreased number of people covered The second part of Moore's claim is that the decision to pass on the full Medicaid expansion caused the state 'to insure fewer people.' The Wisconsin Department of Health Services found nearly 63,000 adults lost their coverage that year through BadgerCare Plus, which administers Medicaid in Wisconsin. The agency attempted to track the insurance status of those adults and could establish that 58 percent of them obtained other insurance coverage or regained BadgerCare coverage. Most of the rest - about 26,000 - were presumed to be uninsured. The state's nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau has also analyzed the impact a change would have today. If Wisconsin accepted the Medicaid expansion now - increasing the allowable threshold in the state from 100 percent of the federal poverty level to 138 percent - the number of childless adults and parents enrolled in BadgerCare would grow an estimated 25 percent, or by about 70,000 people, the agency said. Dyck said it's reasonable to assume a good number of those new enrollees would be moving from uninsured to BadgerCare, given the number of people near poverty who are uninsured. The U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey estimated 38,000 people are uninsured in Wisconsin and have an income between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Those are the people not currently covered by BadgerCare that would be covered if Wisconsin accepted the Medicaid expansion. Our rating Moore said Wisconsin has 'lost' over $1 billion from Walker's decision to turn down the full Medicaid expansion and that Wisconsin is insuring fewer people as a result. That figure is based on an estimate that runs through 2019, so the actual funds missed have not yet topped $1 billion, though they're not far off. And it's not quite right to say Wisconsin 'lost' the money - it just spent that much more due to not receiving federal funds. Meanwhile, a state study confirmed that fewer people were being insured after the 2014 decision. And to add additional support, it's clear more people would be covered if Governor-elect Evers were to accept a Medicaid expansion in the future. We rate Moore's claim Mostly True.","Outgoing Republican Gov. Scott Walker has drawn repeated fire from Democrats for turning down a Medicaid expansion in 2014. With Democrat Tony Evers poised to take over the governor's mansion, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said in a Nov. 8, 2018 interview that she expects Wisconsin will now take those federal dollars. And she expanded on a common claim about the cost of Walker's decision. 'We have lost over $1 billion in not taking the Medicaid expansion money, only to insure fewer people,' Moore said in an the interview on Milwaukee's WTMJ-TV (Channel 4). So the Milwaukee Democrat says the decision not only cost Wisconsin $1 billion, but it resulted in fewer people being insured. We'll dig into both points. Walker declined $1 billion in federal funds We checked a similar $1 billion claim in June, when then-gubernatorial candidate Dana Wachs said Walker 'has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money.' We rated that Mostly True. That item examined an April 2017 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which detailed the federal funds Wisconsin could have received if the state did a full Medicaid expansion in April 2014. Under that expansion, anyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level would have been eligible for Medicaid. Wisconsin would have gained enough additional federal funding to reduce state spending an estimated $1.07 billion on Medicaid from 2014 to 2019, according to the fiscal bureau memo. But since that period has not yet ended, the state has not yet missed out on the full $1 billion. With seven months remaining in the 2018-'19 fiscal year, about $114 million of that has not yet been 'lost,' said Jon Dyck, supervising analyst at the fiscal bureau. He noted, though, that it's not really possible to 'un-lose' that money at this point since the state would be unlikely to reverse that policy by the end of the fiscal year. Walker, who has criticized the full expansion as essentially a new form of welfare, did institute a partial Medicaid expansion, so for the first time everyone in Wisconsin living below the federal poverty level was eligible for Medicaid. (As an aside, we should note the Medicaid coverage limit in various publications is reported as 133 percent or 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The official limit is 133 percent, but there is a 5 percent 'disregard,' which means the functional limit is 138 percent, so that is how we're referring to it.) Medicaid move decreased number of people covered The second part of Moore's claim is that the decision to pass on the full Medicaid expansion caused the state 'to insure fewer people.' The Wisconsin Department of Health Services found nearly 63,000 adults lost their coverage that year through BadgerCare Plus, which administers Medicaid in Wisconsin. The agency attempted to track the insurance status of those adults and could establish that 58 percent of them obtained other insurance coverage or regained BadgerCare coverage. Most of the rest - about 26,000 - were presumed to be uninsured. The state's nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau has also analyzed the impact a change would have today. If Wisconsin accepted the Medicaid expansion now - increasing the allowable threshold in the state from 100 percent of the federal poverty level to 138 percent - the number of childless adults and parents enrolled in BadgerCare would grow an estimated 25 percent, or by about 70,000 people, the agency said. Dyck said it's reasonable to assume a good number of those new enrollees would be moving from uninsured to BadgerCare, given the number of people near poverty who are uninsured. The U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey estimated 38,000 people are uninsured in Wisconsin and have an income between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Those are the people not currently covered by BadgerCare that would be covered if Wisconsin accepted the Medicaid expansion. Our rating Moore said Wisconsin has 'lost' over $1 billion from Walker's decision to turn down the full Medicaid expansion and that Wisconsin is insuring fewer people as a result. That figure is based on an estimate that runs through 2019, so the actual funds missed have not yet topped $1 billion, though they're not far off. And it's not quite right to say Wisconsin 'lost' the money - it just spent that much more due to not receiving federal funds.

Two calculations based on Census data suggest 42,771 or 48,900 uninsured Texas veterans earn less than what would be the poverty threshold for adults qualifying for Medicaid if Texas had embraced that part of the Obamacare law. That's not the same thing as saying they won't 'receive health care'; in fact, some likely qualify now for Medicaid or VA care, but aren't signed up. Hinojosa had a reasonable basis for his figure, but his statement lacked this clarification. We rate it as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE - The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","Discussing the chances that state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, might run for lieutenant governor, state Democratic chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said she has support among veterans who haven't been part of his party's base in the past. '(I)n the state of Texas, especially with Republicans, with Rick Perry refusing to accept the hundred billion dollars in expanded Medicaid, there's 40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of that decision,' Hinojosa said in a Sept. 25, 2013, interview on the YNN cable news channel's 'Capital Tonight' show. Gov. Rick Perry told the federal government that Texas would not expand its Medicaid eligibility to cover more low-income residents, a key Obamacare initiative, in a letter July 19, 2012. It's not clear that federal reimbursements for those new Medicaid enrollees would have reached $100 billion over 10 years; in an April 2013 fact-check, we found a $90 billion estimate wrongly included $11.6 billion that Texas would get whether it expanded Medicaid or not. Since then, Perry has altered his stance: In a Sept. 16, 2013, letter, he directed the state health commission to ask for a lump sum of money (instead of getting federal dollars for each patient) plus the flexibility to use Texas' own criteria to determine who qualifies. We wondered how Hinojosa concluded that rejecting expansion would deprive 40,000 Texas veterans of health care. Democratic Party spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that Hinojosa's claim was based on a March 2013 study by the Washington-based Urban Institute that analyzed Census Bureau data to estimate how many U.S. military veterans aged 19 to 64 in the U.S. don't have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) 'According to the analysis,' Allison said, 'the 48,900 uninsured veterans in Texas whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level could qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act if the governor of Texas expands Medicaid.' On Aug. 6, 2013, our PolitiFact Georgia colleagues checked a statement based on the same study from the institute, which they said described itself as a nonpartisan research center although its leadership includes several former Clinton administration officials. That PolitiFact story rated as True a claim that by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the Obamacare law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage. Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government, aimed at reimbursing doctors who care for patients in low-income groups such as elderly and disabled people, children and pregnant women. Obamacare included a provision that federal money would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level - which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. In Texas, about 1 million adults were on Medicaid in January 2013, according to the website of the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Most were eligible because they were pregnant, disabled, older than 65 or raising children on a household income that was below the federal poverty line. If Texas went along with Obamacare's Medicaid expansion provisions, the state commission's most recent estimates, from 2012, predict another 341,000 Texas adults would get on Medicaid in 2014 -- reflecting people who earn less than $15,800 a year (for a one-person household) but weren't already qualified to get Medicaid for another reason. In a May 2012 report, the Urban Institute said 130,000 non-elderly veterans in Texas have no health insurance -- about 8 percent of the state's veterans and 13.1 percent of its non-elderly veterans. The institute based its estimate on the U.S. Census Bureau's 2009 and 2010 American Community Surveys, adjusted to correct for suspected errors such as high reports of private coverage among low-income families. To describe income groups, the researchers used modified adjusted gross income, the measure that will be used under the Obamacare law. Of those 130,000 non-elderly Texas veterans, the institute's March 2013 study said, 48,900 earned less than 138 percent of the federal poverty guideline. State health commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman emailed us a lower number: 42,771, based on the 2011 American Community Survey. So it looks like more than 40,000 non-elderly veterans would be eligible, total, if Texas expanded Medicaid to all adults earning less than 138 percent of the poverty guideline. Hinojosa said those veterans 'are not going to receive health care.' Experts told us, however, that some might already be eligible for Medicaid or for health care through the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. Under Texas' current Medicaid rules, Goodman said, some of the veterans could be eligible because they are pregnant, have a disability or are raising children on a below-poverty income. 'But we don't have a good way to estimate what that number would be,' she said. Jennifer Haley, an author of the Urban Institute study, told us by email, 'It's definitely the case that some of these veterans are eligible for VA care ... While our data can't tell us which of these uninsured veterans could qualify, many low-income veterans likely would.' Nationwide, about 40 percent of veterans get health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its network of VA hospitals, clinics and other facilities, according to a September 2012 report from the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families at the University of Southern California. According to the VA's website, its full health care plan is generally available free to veterans who have an injury or condition related to their military combat service, to veterans coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan for the first five years after they return and to veterans below certain income thresholds. Others may qualify for part or all of the services at varying costs. Jessica Jacobsen, a spokeswoman at the VA's Dallas office, told us that as of August 2013, 665,000 Texas veterans were enrolled in VA care and 440,000 were eligible but unenrolled. Many of those unenrolled, however, could have private or other government coverage, as more than half of veterans nationwide do according to the veterans center report. Among Texas' low-income veterans, Haley said, 'There are a number of factors that could keep these eligible veterans from enrolling' in VA care - lack of information about VA coverage, for example. 'It's also possible that some may live too far from VA facilities and they are therefore not convenient options.'",,,,"40,000 veterans in Texas won't get health care because Perry rejected Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

We rate this claim False.","Over the years, many claims have misrepresented Bill Gates' views on how expanding access to health care - including vaccines - will lead people to have smaller families. An Oct. 6 article published on the website Tech Startups added a new claim to the list by alleging that 11 years ago, Bill Gates talked about reducing the global population by 10% to 15% 'using new vaccines for population control.' 'Bill Gates talked about using vaccines to control population growth, here is the unedited 2010 TED Talk video,' the headline said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) TechStartups included a YouTube clip of Gates' 2010 TEDTalk presentation called 'Innovating to zero!' His presentation focused on lowering carbon dioxide emissions down to zero. In the clip, Gates introduces a mathematical equation to calculate the amount of global emissions and how to lower it. Part of that equation included the size of the global population. 'The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion,' Gates said. 'Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%.' The full video is 27 minutes and available on the TEDTalk website. Gates' comment about the population was a fragment of his speech. He spoke largely about the types of energy and actions that produce CO2, and proposed a solution of energy measures, like nuclear, wind and solar, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions a great deal by 2050. His point about vaccines has been commonly misconstrued as a plot to depopulate the planet. In 2018, PolitiFact debunked a similar claim. Melinda Gates wrote this in the former couple's annual letter: 'When more children live past age five, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don't go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they're confident those children will survive into adulthood. Big families are in some ways an insurance policy against the tragic likelihood of losing a son or a daughter.' Bill Gates further outlined the idea in a separate video, showing a chart that illustrated the inclining growth rate of the world's population and the effect of improving health care.

6076,3999,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/customs-agents-bus-citizenship/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In January 2018, a Florida activist's video showing immigration officials asking Greyhound passengers for their papers caused some confusion about whether this shows an actual encounter. It does. The footage, posted by Tomas Kennedy, legitimately shows Customs and Border Protection officers boarding a Greyhound bus in Fort Lauderdale on 19 January 2018 and arresting one passenger. Greyhound had reportedly told passengers that they would be subject to a routine security check, not an immigration-related action: The video was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, where it was posted by the Florida Immigration Coalition (FLIC). (Kennedy is the deputy political director for an affiliated group, FLIC Votes.) He urged people to call FLIC, and wrote: Border Patrol got on a Greyhound bus yesterday at 4:30pm in Fort Lauderdale and asked every passenger for their papers and to prove citizenship. Proof of citizenship is NOT required to ride a bus! The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida told us in a statement that it is 'extremely concerned' by the footage and is investigating the encounter: Immigration raids yield to unconstitutional practices that can violate the right to equal protection and the Fourth Amendment by coercing vulnerable individuals to submit to interrogations about their citizenship and immigration status, conducting unreasonable searches and seizure and targeting people of color. However, this is not a new practice. While Greyhound requires identification - but not citizenship - for people riding within the boundaries of the United States, the company has typically cooperated with immigration officials; in 2008 a Greyhound spokesperson told the New York Times: We are under no obligation to inform customers of law enforcement activity at any time. As the ACLU has noted, Customs and Border Protection agents have the authority to operate within 100 miles of any U.S. 'external boundary,' including states with coastal borders like Florida. However, according to the ACLU: In practice, Border Patrol agents routinely ignore or misunderstand the limits of their legal authority in the course of individual stops, resulting in violations of the constitutional rights of innocent people. These problems are compounded by inadequate training for Border Patrol agents, a lack of oversight by CBP and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the consistent failure of CBP to hold agents accountable for abuse. Thus, although the 100-mile border zone is not literally 'Constitution free,' the U.S. government frequently acts like it is. University of Southern California law professor Niels Frenzen tells us that although it may be illegal to lie to federal law enforcement officers, it is not illegal for citizens to refuse to talk to them. Frenzen, who is the director of the immigration clinic at the USC Gould School of Law, told us: If it's literally an encounter on a bus in an interior checkpoint on the street and if the only thing the officer says is, 'Sir what's your citizenship, what's your immigration status,' and you ignore the officer or you decline to answer, that in and of itself does not give the officer probable cause to make an arrest. Denis L. Gilman, who helms a similar clinic at the University of Texas at Austin school of law, has said that the same principle holds true for motorists. She told the Texas Observer in 2013: So, if you refuse to answer, they can pull you out of the line and over into 'secondary inspection' and they can probably hold you there for about 20 minutes or so. But they cannot do anything more if you continue to refuse to respond unless something else develops during that time period that would lead to probable cause. Frenzen did add that permanent residents (a.k.a. 'green card' holders) are required to not only carry their documentation but produce them if asked by immigration officers. FLIC membership director Isabel Sousa-Rodriguez told Miami New Times that encounters like the one filmed in Fort Lauderdale weaken the public's trust in law enforcement: Without an official judicial warrant, border patrol agents should not be permitted to board the private property of the Greyhound corporation to harass its customers and violate their civil liberties.

With 165 million filers in the U.S., that's about 18 million people, as Obama said. Said Williams: 'Because he would not extend the Obama tax cuts, the people at the bottom who were benefiting from those cuts would see their taxes go up.' It's worth noting that overall, most people's taxes would decrease under Romney's plan. The Tax Policy Center said that 70 percent would get tax cuts averaging almost $4,300 -- a result of the 20 percent rate cut. Our ruling Obama claimed Romney's plan would cut his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families. The Tax Policy Center found that, indeed, even with a 20 percent rate cut, 18 million people would find themselves in a gap where the rate cut wouldn't offset the loss of benefits from the Obama tax cuts Romney would let expire. That is, they'd end up paying more (or getting less in refunds) without the expanded child credit, EITC and education credit. Romney has not explicitly said he wants those tax cuts to end, but his lack of support for extending them means there would be an increase on the 18 million people. Obama's statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.","President Barack Obama says Mitt Romney is the anti-Robin Hood. In a campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, on May 5, 2012, Obama said the Romney's economic plan would raise taxes for millions of low-income Americans while cutting them for the wealthy. Obama told the crowd that Romney 'doesn't seem to understand' that helping the rich doesn't automatically trickle down to benefit the poor. 'Why else would he want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would he propose cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families?' Obama said. Romney's tax plan, unveiled in February, includes a repeal of the estate tax, a decrease in the corporate tax rate and a 20 percent across-the-board rate cut for all personal income tax brackets. So how is it that some people's taxes would actually increase under his plan? We decided to check it out. How Romney would pay less We contacted the Romney campaign for more details on his tax plan but did not hear back. So we're relying on the Romney campaign's description of the tax plan and the analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a well-respected independent group. Romney's tax plan would affect what he personally pays in federal income taxes. With a fortune estimated at between $80 million and $250 million and 2010 earnings of around $21 million, Romney falls in the top tax bracket. That class currently pays a 35 percent rate. His plan would reduce that to 28 percent. 'The tax plan would cut taxes on the rich a lot,' said Roberton Williams, an economist with the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks that published an analysis of Romney's plan. The 20 percent cut, Williams said, is 'a huge savings for the people at the top end.' How others could pay more Romney's tax plan also allows the expiration of tax cuts enacted in the economic stimulus package, including: The American Opportunity Tax Credit raises the maximum education tax credit from $1,800 to $2,500 and it makes the credit partially refundable so low-income people who don't pay any taxes would still benefit. The stimulus bill also increased the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families from 40 percent to 45 percent. An extension enacted in 2010 increased the maximum credit for families with three or more children from $5,236 to $5,891 in 2011. The child credit, a tax benefit to offset the cost of raising a child, is a partially refundable credit of up to $1,000 per child. Recent legislation lowered the threshold for qualifying, so that working families with earnings above $3,000 qualify for at least a partial credit. These tax cuts provide substantial cuts for low-income taxpayers. And since Romney's plan would allow them to expire, that's who would see a tax increase under his proposal.

FALSE Example: [Collected via email, November 2015] I just saw something incredibly alarming claiming Germany and some other EU countries are going to legalize pedophilia-is this possible? Origins: In the 1980s, Germany's Green Party co-leader, Jürgen Trittin, released an election pamphlet lobbying to legalize sex between children and adults. It also actively promoted the agenda of pedophile groups. The support for legalized pedophilia officially ended in 1990, and Green Party officials, by all accounts, tried to permanently distance themselves from it. Trittin has said that his party's stance on pedophilia was intended to shock and push back against Germany's criminalization of homosexuality (Paragraph 175, which was ended in 1994.) He told members of the press in 2013, 'In the founding phase of the Greens, gay and lesbian groups were campaigning to reverse discrimination of a kind you can hardly imagine today. The impetus for liberalisation and decriminalisation overshot its target. And it overshot, because there was the fiction that - beyond violence and the abuse of a relationship of trust - there could be sexual relations between adults and children.' The story has been in headlines in recent months after an internal investigation by Germany's Green Party concluded that the group, in the 1980s, did, in fact, support the country's 'pedosexual movement,' which advocated for 'consensual relations' between adults and children (not dissimilar to other groups in Europe and North America, such as the North American Man/Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, which still has a high-profile presence in the United States.) Members of the Green Party apologized to victims of past sexual abuse for trivializing their experiences. An unrelated pamphlet, first published in 2001, has been cited as evidence that Germany is legalizing pedophilia, as it advocates, among other things, that parents 'tickle, caress, and kiss the child in various places while it is being cleaned.' In fact, it was part of a push for early childhood sex education. The pamphlet was written by Ina-Marie Phillips and distributed by Germany's Federal Center for Health Education (BZgA). The offending passages, argue supporters, have been taken out of context and are an attempt to help parents and children identify the difference between normal touches and cuddling and sexual abuse. However, the pamphlet was out of print as of 2007. It is worth noting that Germany today has some of the most groundbreaking treatment for pedophiles in the world, with its national 'Don't Offend' network and campaign. Its treatment is aimed at active prevention of child sex abuse rather than punishment after the fact, giving potential abusers therapy and support.

It has since circulated in multiple versions, the most recent being cast as a letter sent by James 'Mad Dog' Mattis, the recently installed Defense Secretary for the Trump administration: A liberal female from San Francisco wrote a lot of letters to the U.S. government, complaining about the treatment of captive insurgents (terrorists) being held in GITMO. She demanded a response to her letter. She received back the following reply: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HONORABLE JAMES 'MAD DOG' MATTIS PENTAGON WASHINGTON, DC Dear Concerned Citizen, Thank you for your recent letter expressing your profound concern of treatment of the Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists captured by American Forces, who were subsequently transferred to the GITMO. Our administration takes these matters seriously and your opinions were heard loud and clear here at the Pentagon .. You will be pleased to learn, thanks to the concerns of citizens like yourself, we are creating a new department here at the Defense Department to be called 'Liberals Accept Responsibility for Killers' program, or L.A.R.K. for short. In accordance with the guidelines of this new program, we have decided, on a trial basis, to divert several terrorists and place them in homes of concerned citizens such as yourself, around the country, under those citizens personal care. Your personal detainee has been selected and is scheduled for transportation under heavily armed guard to your residence in San Francisco next Monday. Ali Mohammed Ahmed bin Mahmud is your detainee, and is to be cared for pursuant to the standards you personally demanded in your letter of complaint. You will be pleased to know that we will conduct weekly inspections to ensure that your standards of care for Ahmed are commensurate with your recommendations. Although Ahmed is a sociopath and extremely violent, we hope that your sensitivity to what you described as his 'attitudinal problem' will help him overcome those character flaws. Perhaps you are correct in describing these problems as mere cultural differences. We understand that you plan to offer counselling and home schooling, however, we strongly recommend that you hire some assistant caretakers. Please advise any Jewish friends, neighbors or relatives about your house guest, as he might get agitated or even violent, but we are sure you can reason with him. He is also expert at making a wide variety of explosive devices from common household products, so you may wish to keep those items locked up, unless in your opinion, this might offend him. Your adopted terrorist is extremely proficient in hand-to-hand combat and can extinguish human life with such simple items as a pencil or nail clippers. We advise that you do not ask him to demonstrate these skills either in your home or wherever you choose to take him while helping him adjust to life in our country. Ahmed will not wish to interact with you or your daughters except sexually, since he views females as a form of property, thereby having no rights, including refusal of his sexual demands. This is a particularly sensitive subject for him. You also should know that he has shown violent tendencies around women who fail to comply with the dress code that he will recommend as more appropriate attire. I'm sure you will come to enjoy the anonymity offered by the burka over time. Just remember that it is all part of respecting his culture and religious beliefs' as described in your letter. You take good care of Ahmed and remember that we will try to have a counselor available to help you over any difficulties you encounter while Ahmed is adjusting to American culture. Thanks again for your concern. We truly appreciate it when folks like you keep us informed of the proper way to do our job and care for our fellow man. Good luck and God bless you. Cordially, 'Mad Dog' Mattis Secretary of Defense Rest assured this was never a letter sent out by anyone representing the White House; it is instead one anonymous author's idea of what the administration should be replying to those who criticize the conditions under which Taliban and other terrorist detainees were housed at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The Guantanamo Bay facility (abbreviated as GTMO, hence its 'Gitmo' nickname) has been decried as inhumane by a number of human rights associations and has been denounced at various times in the American press. As we detailed in our article about a Charlie Daniels essay on the situation at Gitmo, the detainees were initially incarcerated at Camp X-Ray, a temporary holding facility near Guantanamo Bay. Inmates were kept in tin-roofed 8×8 cells that resembled dog runs: chain link fencing on a concrete base, open on the sides to the elements. They slept on foam pads placed on concrete floors in cells containing chemical toilets or buckets. At least every two days prisoners would be taken from their cells for all of 15 minutes of exercise. Those being held were later moved to nearby Camp Delta, a permanent detention center erected for this purpose. The 8×6.66 cells had beds and walls and windows, flush toilets and running water, but could still be described as austere. Some were outraged by the apparent human rights violations found at Gitmo. Others viewed the method of foreign fighters' detainment at that facility as a necessary evil if those being held were to be prevented from inflicting harm on others. Members of yet another faction regarded the matter as one of severe punishment justly earned by foreign fighters not entitled to the protections afforded under the Geneva code to conventional, uniformed prisoners of war. That divergence of opinion led to members of the first and third groups (and sometimes the second) regarding one another as fool-headed in their assessments and hopelessly out of touch with the core issues at stake. The Internet piece about the fictional LARK program was penned from such a soapbox, its author expressing through the vehicle of humor the opinion that those decrying the condition of the prisoners would quickly change their tune if they were the ones responsible for incarcerating Taliban and al Qaeda detainees. That line of thought was not original to the unknown author of the Internet piece, as evidenced by a Jim Huber 'Politically Correct' cartoon published in January 2002. This item (which regardless of one's viewpoint is nonetheless a well-crafted use of satire - it is a playfully entertaining read that makes its point in none-too-subtle fashion) has gone through a few revisions as it has been spread its 2002 debut, most notably the change of the signature line from 'Cordially, George W. Bush' to 'Cordially ... Your Buddy, Don Rumsfeld.' This shift reflected a then-current societal perception of U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as the one responsible for tough treatment of captured foreign fighters, a view that was somewhat subscribed to in 2002 but which gained far wider acceptance in 2004 thanks to the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq. Other textual alterations included the elision of this segment of the 2002 version: Ahmed's meal requirements are simple, but we strongly suggest serving meals that do not require utensils, particularly knives and forks. Also, these should be 'one-handed' foods; Ahmed will not eat with his left hand since he uses it to wipe himself after purging his bowels (which he will do in your yard) - but look on the bright side.. no increase in the toilet paper bill. He generally bathes quarterly with the change of seasons, assuming that it rains, and he washes his clothes simultaneously. This should help with your water bill. Also, your new friend has a really bad case of body lice that hasn't been completely remedied. Please heed the large orange notice attached to your detainee's cage: 'Does not play well with others.' The section on how the fictional prisoner will get along with women in the LARK recipient's household was changed in later versions: Ahmed will not wish to interact with your wife or daughters (except sexually) since he views females as a subhuman form of property. This is a particularly sensitive subject for him, and he has been known to show violent tendencies around women who fail to comply with the new dress code that Ahmed will recommend as more appropriate attire. I'm sure they will come to enjoy the anonymity offered by the bhurka - over time. Just remind them that it is all part of 'respecting his culture and his religious beliefs' - wasn't that how you put it? Ahmed will not wish to interact with your wife or daughters (except sexually) since he views females as a subhuman form of property. However, he will be eager to assist with the education of your sons; have available for their use several copies of the Q'uran. Oh - and rest assured he absolutely loves animals, especially cats and dogs. He prefers them roasted, but raw is fine, too, if they aren't more than 2 or 3 days dead. The closing was also altered: Thanks again for your letter. We truly appreciate it when folks like you, who know so much, keep us informed of the proper way to do our job. You take good care of Ahmed - and remember...we'll be watching. Good luck! Thanks again for your letter. We truly appreciate it when folks like you, who know so much, keep us informed of the proper way to do our job. We think this watching over each other's shoulder is such a good way for people to interact that we will be sending a team of federal officials with expertise in your line of work to your place of business soon, just to help you do your job better. Don't be concerned that they have the power to close your business, seize your property, and arrest you for any violation of the 4,850,206 laws, codes, regulations and rules that apply to your profession. They're really there just to make sure you're doing everything the proper way. That is what you wanted, right? Well, thank you for this opportunity to interact with such a valued member of the citizenry. You take good care of Ahmed - and remember...we'll be watching. The later cropping of the original closing paragraphs removed a key element from the piece, that of its writer's indignation over the Gitmo's decriers' insistence that a team of observers not allied with or controlled by the U.S. military be tasked with supervising the conditions under which prisoners are housed at that facility.",Gitmo Detainees and the LARK Program A letter describing a LARK program under which Gitmo detainees will be housed with liberals who object to the current treatment of those prisoners is a piece of satire.

Any carbon dioxide concentrations above' 2,000 parts per million are 'dangerous!' There is no evidence that children's health is endangered by a buildup of carbon dioxide caused by masks. We rate the post False.","A Facebook post alluding to COVID-19 carried this admonishment: 'WARNING UNMASK YOUR KIDS! Any Carbon Dioxide concentrations above 2000ppm is dangerous!' The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that masks endanger children by trapping carbon dioxide. As evidence for its claim, the Facebook post shares a minute-long TikTok video that purports to show a handheld device measuring carbon dioxide levels inside a paper medical mask being worn by a young girl. At one point, the readings exceeded 7,100, according to a woman in the video, who adds: 'Remember, anything above 2,000 is unacceptable.' It's not clear in this claim what 2,000 parts per million refers to, but this is the latest in a series of claims made with demonstrations that don't actually show what they claim to show. Here's what we know based in part from our latest check, on a claim that a similar demonstration with an oxygen sensor shows that cloth masks are dangerous for children, which we rated False: The air we breathe is made up of about 78% nitrogen by volume, 21% oxygen and much smaller amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and other gases. Kirsten Koehler, an environmental health and engineering professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the kind of sensor seen in this video is not suited to do what the demonstrator suggests its measuring. 'As with the concentration of O2, the concentration of CO2 in the air in the mask will be changing dramatically, very rapidly with each breath,' Koehler said. 'These types of sensors are not able to respond to these changes.' The result is that what the sensor measures is not accurate for either inhaled or exhaled air. 'If masks were really dangerous, you would expect to see changes in the oxygen saturation of blood,' she said. 'However, as numerous videos online and several peer-reviewed publications show, oxygen saturation in blood does not change when wearing a mask, even when exercising.' Biology professor Benjamin Neuman, chief virologist at Texas A&M University's Global Health Research Complex, said such tests - holding a device just inside a child's mask - do not tell the difference between exhaled air, which is high in carbon dioxide, from inhaled air, which is low in carbon dioxide, because the monitor is under the mask where the child is both inhaling and exhaling. Holding a meter up to exhaled air would give the result shown. But the mask is porous, and most of the air for each new breath comes in through the mask.' A more accurate way to assess the effect of a mask on oxygen flow is to analyze a blood sample, Neuman said. Or, 'a reasonable do-it-yourself test would be to wear a pulse oximeter while wearing a mask or not wearing a mask for longer periods of time, perhaps half an hour each, and then compare oxygen saturation levels.' The test would have to be repeated several times to get an accurate reading. 'Fortunately, this work has already been done quite carefully in several papers, which demonstrated no significant drop in oxygen content or rise in carbon dioxide content when wearing a mask,' Neuman said. PolitiFact reporting has found that science shows mask-wearing is largely safe for children. Scientists have found little evidence that the kind of masks worn by students negatively affect oxygen or carbon dioxide levels, and they say that contamination levels on masks are no worse than on other common objects. The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency, according to the World Health Organization. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: 'Wearing a mask does not raise the carbon dioxide (CO2) level in the air you breathe. Cloth masks and surgical masks do not provide an airtight fit across the face. The CO2 escapes into the air through the mask when you breathe out or talk. CO2 molecules are small enough to easily pass through mask material. In contrast, the respiratory droplets that carry the virus that causes COVID-19 are much larger than CO2, so they cannot pass as easily through a properly designed and properly worn mask.' Babak Javid, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, told PolitiFact that the issue 'has been convincingly debunked.'",,,,"'Unmask your kids!

17606,5263,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/anthony-bourdain-expose-elite-ring/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"As much of the world grieved the death of TV celebrity and food writer Anthony Bourdain, the Neon Nettle fake news site shamelessly exploited the tragedy to push out yet another fabricated clickbait story about 'elite pedophile rings.' A 9 June 2018 Neon Nettle article headlined 'Anthony Bourdain Was About to Expose an Elite Pedophile Ring Before He Died' stated the following: As the world still reels in shock at the news that journalist Anthony Bourdain has been found dead, evidence is now emerging that the mainstream reporter was about to expose an elite pedophile ring just before he died. More recently, following news of a major child trafficking bust, sources are stating that Bourdain was planning on running 'an exposé' and the sex slave network. However, the text of the article was a typical Neon Nettle disjointed word salad that provided absolutely no substantiation or documentation for their assertion that Bourdain was 'about to expose an elite pedophile ring.' The sum total of the case presented by Neon Nettle was a pair of out-of-context tweets from Bourdain, which Neon Nettle attempted to spin as evidence of some undefined conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein: know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She's not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years - Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017 So go for it , but no one would give a shit if it wasn't Trump and he wasn't President. A lot of people are shady, or assholes , that mean the Feds can jack you up? He was shady 2 years ago no warrants? - Jeff Hulme (@jeffhulme) May 2, 2018 Certainly Bourdain had openly criticized Hillary Clinton's response when film producer Harvey Weinstein - a longtime Clinton donor - was accused of sexually assaulting and harassing dozens of women, including Bourdain's girlfriend, Asia Argento. Bourdain expressed incredulity that Clinton could have been unaware of Weinstein's sexual misbehavior, but the Weinstein scandal had nothing to do with a child sex trafficking sting later conducted in the Atlanta area, to which Neon Nettle bizarrely attempted to link it. Neon Nettle's tortured logic seemed to be that Bourdain's Parts Unknown program aired on CNN, and CNN is headquartered in Atlanta, where a child sex-trafficking ring was recently busted, so ... something. The bottom line is that absolutely nothing suggests Anthony Bourdain knew about, much less was planning to expose, any 'elite pedophile ring.' Neon Nettle also tossed an abundance of obfuscatory false and misleading statements into their word salad to deflect from the article's complete lack of substance: o Although Mr. Bourdain's death has been officially declared a suicide, many see his untimely passing a suspicious and unexpected. Bourdain's death may have been unexpected to many, but that it was the result of a suicide is not rationally disputed. o It's no secret that people who cross the Clintons' path end up dead ... Usually from suicide. This statement is nothing more than a rehash of rumors we first debunked here over twenty years ago. And it's irrelevant, as Bourdain plainly expressed that he didn't believe Hillary Clinton was in any way responsible for Harvey Weinstein's crimes: Hillary is CLEARLY not responsible for anything Weinstein Thats screamingly obvious. Her response to questions though has been uninspiring - Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 12, 2017 o Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself. According to Spade's family, she had also been threatened for speaking out. Again, there is no 'reportedly' to designer Kate Spade's death by suicide. And what Spade's sister maintained she was 'threatened' over was speaking out about her sibling's mental illness, not anything remotely related to child sex trafficking or 'pedophile rings.' o More recently, following news of a major child trafficking bust, sources are stating that Bourdain was planning on running 'an exposé' and the sex slave network. We found zero evidence of any 'source' - outside of disreputable Neon Nettle itself - stating that Bourdain had plans to run a 'sex slave network exposé' on his travel and food show. (Naturally, Neon Nettle neither identified nor linked to a any such 'source.') o Despite reports that 160 children were rescued and will almost 150 arrested during the raids [in Atlanta], Mr. Bourdain's network, CNN, has refused to cover the case. Even more bizarrely, suspicious 'fact-checking' website Snopes even went as far as to debunk reports that the raids even took place. This statement was completely and utterly untrue. We debunked false reports that a so-called 'child trafficking bunker' had been discovered near Tucson (it was actually an abandoned homeless encampment); we wrote nothing about the completely unrelated Operation Safe Summer raids conducted by the FBI's Atlanta field office. o A group of retired veterans uncovered child trafficking camp in the Tucson, Arizona. After accidentally stumbling upon the 'pedophile bunker' whilst looking for homeless vets, they found children's toys, pornography, and even a human skull believed to belong to a child aged 7-8. Again, not only is the Tucson 'pedophile bunker' claim false, but the related rumor that a child's skull' was found at the site is untrue as well. (The skull was that of an adult, not a child, and it was found in a remote area more than twenty miles northwest of Tucson, not at the site of the supposed 'pedophile bunker.') All of this misreporting was par for the course for Neon Nettle, a notorious fake news site with a predilection for publishing sensationalized and exaggerated (if not completely fabricated) stories about pedophiles. True to form, Neon Nettle added multiple false elements to this particular report to enhance its luridness.","Was Anthony Bourdain About to Expose an Elite Pedophile Ring?

22675,11689,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/go-ask-alice-2/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Our fascination for associating wholesome, innocent icons of popular culture with hidden depravities and unsavory backgrounds seemingly knows no bounds. Thus we have tales that nature-loving pop singer John Denver was a Vietnam-era sniper, that genial children's TV host Fred Rogers served as a Navy SEAL, that the actor who portrayed geeky Paul Pfeiffer on TV's popular The Wonder Years grew up to become shock rocker Marilyn Manson, and that the host of Nickelodeon's preschooler favorite Blue's Clues died of a drug overdose. As the epitomical producer of popular children's fare, Disney comes in for more than its fair share of such rumors: scandalous tales about both Walt Disney himself (e.g., that he was booted out of the military, that he was a Nazi sympathizer, that he was an illegitimate child) and many of the films produced by the company he founded. A common motif among Disney legends is the claim that various Disney animated films were drug-inspired; that Disney and his band of animators were users of hallucinogens such as LSD, and their experiences with drugs formed the basis for such fare as the fantasy world of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the colorful visual interpretation of musical themes in Fantasia, and the surreal psychedelia of Alice in Wonderland. On a literal level, not much can be said to address these rumors other than to cite a litany of negative evidence. Walt Disney and his principal animators are well-known figures about whom much has been written, and no one who knew or worked with them claimed (or even suggested) that they partook of recreational drugs. And although drug abuse was enough of a social concern to prompt didactic scare films such as Reefer Madness and The Cocaine Fiends back in the 1930s, the 'drug' of choice in Walt Disney's era was far more likely to have been alcohol than anything else. (Recall that the hallucinatory 'Pink Elephants on Parade' sequence in 1941's Dumbo is triggered when the diminutive pachyderm inadvertently imbibes a tubful of champagne.) As for LSD, it wasn't even brought to the USA until 1949, too late to have been the driving force behind Disney's classic animated films (although alternative hallucinogens such as mescaline were certainly obtainable.) Of the notion that the imagination displayed in Disney's animated films was drug-induced, animator Art Babbitt, who drew the dancing mushrooms in 'The Nutcracker Suite' portion of Fantasia, sarcastically quipped: 'Yes, it is true. I myself was addicted to Ex-lax and Feenamint.' Drug rumors were undoubtedly fueled because Fantasia and Alice in Wonderland received mixed reviews upon their initial releases, and neither was much of a financial success until their re-releases (and availability as rental films) in the late 1960s and early 1970s drew crowds of college students who found the films' melding of color, light, music, and imagery made them ideal psychedelic 'head' flicks. So much so, in fact, that Disney's marketing began to pitch these films to such audiences: After [Fantasia's] 1969 rerelease proved a cult hit among college-age kids looking for a hallucinogenic experience, conservative groups began picketing movie theaters for screening Disney's animated 'drug fantasies.' Hippie-era moviegoers liked to sit in the front row, even on top of each other, smoking pot and offering advice to Mickey. The company asked the theaters to promote the film not as typical Disney fare, but 'now you sell Fantasia as you did Easy Rider. Hip youngsters come to see it as a special kind of trip.' Disney didn't exactly discourage the connotation. Psychedelic posters and other ad materials featuring Chernobog and the dancing mushrooms called it 'The Ultimate Experience,' while the promotional kit quoted one underground review: 'Disney's Fantasia: A Head Classic: Representation of sound as color does resemble tripping on STD, LSD, THC and various other letters of the alphabet.' Long afterwards, fans continued to ask the animators if they were 'on something' when they made [Alice in Wonderland]. It's not such an odd question, considering that all the things in the book and movie that suggest drugs: Alice ingests potions, wafers and mushrooms that change her size or alter her consciousness, her perspective constantly changes, she loses track of time, space and her own identity. There's the hookah-smoking caterpillar. In fact, the entire story, a dream framed by the 'real world,' might be seen as a hallucination or trip. So, it wasn't surprising that in 1971 Alice in Wonderland was the top renting 16mm film in every college town across the country, playing to capacity crowds in heavy smoke-filled fraternity houses, university theaters, discos and private homes, where it sometimes ran over and over again for an entire weekend. After the smash cult revival of Fantasia, Disney withdrew the 16mm prints of Alice and targeted a 1974 theater rerelease. The studio prepared ads with copy such as 'Down the rabbit hole and through the talking door lies a world where vibrant colors merge into shapes of fantasy, and music radiates from flowers,' 'Nine out of ten Dormice recommend Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland for visual euphoria and good, clean nonsense,' and 'Should you see it? Go ask Alice,' a reference to Jefferson Airplane's song 'White Rabbit.' Also of significance is that all the plot aspects of Alice in Wonderland which 'suggest drugs' were present in Lewis Carroll's original work, and Disney merely adapted them for the screen. As for the original example, Walt Disney didn't 'invent' Snow White, of course - the film was based on the European version of that fairy tale as collected by the Grimm brothers over a century earlier. Disney did flesh the story out to feature film length, though, and he was the one who created names and distinctive personalities for each of the seven dwarfs. But the suggestion that the dwarfs' names correspond (intentionally or otherwise) to the symptoms of various stages of cocaine addiction is bunk. Cocaine addiction might be considered to have identifiable stages, but no standard set of physical symptoms accompanies each stage. Many types of drug abuse (and physical or mental illnesses) can produce symptoms such as changes in sleep/wake patterns (sleepy), mood swings (happy, grumpy), alteration of personality (dopey, bashful), and allergies (sneezy) - eventually necessitating a trip to the doc.",Dwarfs on Drugs Spurious rumor holds that the personalities of Disney's seven dwarfs represent the seven stages of cocaine addiction.

In a video filmed by the kitty's owner, he's just chilling on the kitchen counter. Unsurprisingly, his ridiculously low voice has gone viral, with a lot of people wondering how it's physically possible for such a tiny cat to produce such a noise. There are several reasons to be skeptical about this footage. The video was originally posted to YouTube by 'Cash CatFlava' in December 2015, bearing the description 'So this is Jack and he has some sort of type of laryngeal paralysis? At least thats what the vet told me.' Some cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: 'While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat's meow, I've yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat's meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn't change over time!' According to the American College of Veterinarian Surgeons, a cat with laryngeal paralysis may display harsh panting or a coarse (not deeper) voice: In dogs and cats with laryngeal paralysis, the muscles that normally pull the airway open do not function properly. When an affected pet breathes in, the walls of the airway do not pull open-rather, they are sucked into the opening, or in severe cases sucked shut. Early in the condition, this creates increased noise when they breathe; later, it can completely obstruct their airway, and they can suffocate. The early signs of laryngeal paralysis can be quite subtle. You may notice: harshness in their panting increased panting or panting when cool and calm a hoarse or raspy-sounding bark A video of a cat suffering from laryngeal paralysis shows that their meows are not comically deep, but squeaky (and arguably a little sad): Our attempts to find similar videos of cats with unusually deep voices were unsuccessful. In fact, the only similar video we could uncover was uploaded by the same YouTube account, Cash Cat Flava, in October 2013: Setting aside for the moment what a coincidence it would be that the same person has come across two cats with laryngeal paralysis who sound identical, this video actually gives itself away as a fakery in the first few seconds. Before the cat exits the house, you can hear audio of its actual regular-pitched meow.",Does This Cat Have an Unusually Deep Voice? A video purportedly shows a feline with an extremely deep meow.

19210,7188,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colorado-infant-become-first-pot-overdose-death/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"'First ever' marijuana death stories are popular, but almost universally misreported. Adding to this voluminous genre was a story published in November 2017 in the Reno Gazette Journal which, after copious aggregation and sharing, was reported under a Fox News byline on the New York Post website as: Baby boy is reportedly first pot overdose death. The claim originated from a March 2017 case report about a Colorado infant who died in 2015 from myocarditis, an inflammation of heart tissue that can in some cases lead to cardiac arrest.The infant, forensic tests showed, had been exposed to marijuana at some point two to six days prior to his death. Case reports like this are, by their nature, descriptive accounts of phenomena seen by practicing doctors which they then deem novel enough to report to the broader scientific community. They are not in-depth scientific investigations that could be used to provide an official cause of death. Despite this, when the Reno Gazette Journal first reported on the case study on 16 November 2017, they inaccurately suggested that the doctors 1) had claimed to prove a causal relationship between marijuana and the boy's death; and 2) that the doctors claimed that this was the first ever reported case of a marijuana overdose: Two poison control doctors claim to have documented the first known case of death by marijuana overdose, sparking a medical debate over what killed an 11-month-old baby in Colorado two years ago. Neither assertion is true. The authors do not claim to have documented the first 'pot overdose death' but instead is proposed this case to be the first infant death associated with cannabis exposure: As of this writing, this is the first reported pediatric death associated with cannabis exposure. The authors were not claiming to document cause, only an association, and their literature review regarding death from cannabis exposure was necessarily limited to infants. Claims of the 'first ever' death from marijuana are frequently made by scientists or doctors regarding adults, heavily reported on by media, and often rejected by the larger scientific community. This doctors behind this case report did not make such a bold claim, they merely wrote a narrative account of a boy who died within a window of time plausibly related to marijuana ingestion, and made a note of it for the scientific community so that, should similar accounts emerge, further study can be justified: Given two rare occurrences with a clear temporal relationship - the recent exposure to cannabis and the myocarditis-associated cardiac arrest - we believe there exists a plausible relationship that justifies further research into cannabis-associated cardiotoxicity and related practice adjustments. As we have written about in detail, there have been a number of case studies and reviews suggesting that marijuana - which causes an increase in blood pressure among other things - has triggered, or could be associated with, increased risk of heart attacks in adults with other known risk factors. Death from direct cannabis toxicity is widely considered to be impossible, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (and other foreign health organizations) says that there have been no official documented cases of marijuana overdose. Speaking to the Washington Post, Thomas Nappe, an author of the case study who is now the director of medical toxicology at St. Luke's University Health Network in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said their work was fatally misinterpreted: 'We are absolutely not saying that marijuana killed that child.' [...] Nappe [...] explained that the doctors simply observed this unusual sequence of events, documented it and alerted the medical community that it is worth studying a possible relationship between cannabis and the child's cause of death, myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Because the assertions made by the scientists in the case study do not align in anyway with the study's more sensationalized coverage, we rank the claim that this paper conclusively attributed a Colorado infants death to cannabis for the first time as false. ","Did a Colorado Infant Become the 'First Pot Overdose Death'? 'We are absolutely not saying that marijuana killed that child,' the co-author of a recently misread case study told a reporter.

'I have voted 'No' on CS/CS/SB 5-D and CS/SB 6-D because it raises the state sales tax from 5 cents to 6 cents. This merely continues to raise the needed revenue for our state from the same shrinking base and remains as regressive as it was at 5 cents. Florida has serious needs, but to continue 'business as usual' will not solve the long term needs of this state.' Would Florida's economy be in a stronger place if the tax had remained? 'I think it unquestionably would,' Frishe told PolitiFact Florida. We asked Brandes for his thoughts, even though he did not sponsor the ad. 'I think the question is, is it a fact that Jim Frishe voted to raise taxes?' Brandes said. 'Not that he later changed his mind. And I think clearly it's a fact that he did.' Our ruling A third-party group says Frishe voted to tax people for 'doing our taxes.' In 1987, Frishe did vote for a plan to tax services in the state of Florida, including accountants' fees. Featured Fact-check Kevin McCarthy stated on November 18, 2021 in a House floor speech 'Never in American history has so much been spent at one time. Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending.' By Louis Jacobson • November 19, 2021 He later said he favored a proposal to repeal the services tax, but he could not support the repeal in the Legislature becuase it included a provision that raised the sales tax on goods. While those caveats give a fuller picture of Frishe's position and his vote, they do not undermine the statement made by the group Accountability in Government. We rate the claim True.","St. Petersburg Rep. Jim Frishe got his start in the Florida House in the 1980s, when the Republican served six years and took a vote to raise taxes. The widely unpopular 'services tax' of 1987 was repealed months later amid a public uproar. But a group supporting his GOP opponent in the Senate District 22 primary isn't letting Frishe, or voters, forget that initial vote. A television commercial riffs Frishe's own slogan -- 'This Republican has walked the walk for over 40 years' -- by saying he's trampled voters with new taxes. Man: 'Jim Frishe says he's walked the walk in politics for 40 years. The truth is, he's walked all over us with taxes.' Woman: 'Yeah, Frishe voted to raise our taxes on everything from dry-cleaning to pest control. Forty years is enough.' Second woman: 'Frishe voted to increase fees on car tags and fishing permits.' Second man: 'Frishe even wanted to tax accountants.' Third woman: 'You mean he wants to tax us for doing our taxes?' Third man: 'Forty years of this is enough.' Fourth woman: 'More than enough.' The ad is sponsored by Accountability in Government, an electioneering group that supports St. Petersburg Republican Rep. Jeff Brandes for the seat. We tried to contact the group's chairman but did not hear back. The group sponsors a website, 40yearsisenough.com, that contains a lengthy document of news clips summarizing the tax controversy and newspaper editorials against Frishe. (As an aside, we want to first address the 'Forty years is enough' rhetoric. It's taken from Frishe's own ads, where he talks about being active within the Republican Party and for Ronald Reagan. To be clear, he has served six terms in the Legislature. Six years from 1984 to 1990, and six more from 2006-2012.) Of all the tax claims, we were most intrigued by the exchange about taxing accountant services. Did Frishe really want to 'tax us for doing our taxes?' The tone of the ad might suggest the taxes Frishe supported stuck. The truth is, some did and some didn't, and some votes referenced in the ad happened more than 20 years apart. This vote on taxing accountant services, among many other services, happened 25 years ago. Tampa Republican Bob Martinez was governor and Democrats controlled the Legislature. Frishe was in the Republican minority. There was a push that year to broaden the state's tax base, Frishe explained. There was no recession that year; rather, Florida's economy was booming. Still, the state needed money to fix roads and pay for an influx of new public school students. To do that, the Legislature passed a 5 percent sales tax on many personal and professional services, including accountants' fees, agricultural services, house-building, architect and engineering fees, pest control, cleaning services, computer and data processing, advertising, legal fees, magazine and newspaper subscriptions and newspaper rack sales, pet-grooming and cleaning services. The April vote on SB 777 was 83-31, with some Pinellas County Republicans, including Frishe, former Rep. and Sen. Dennis Jones, and current lobbyist Pete Dunbar, joining the Democrats to pass it despite the objections of many conservatives. Lawmakers said it was the biggest tax increase in state history and expected it to raise $761.1 million for the state in its first year and $1.2 billion the year after that. Martinez swiftly signed it into law. 'There is no joy and glee in taxation, but there is a sense that this House and this Senate have taken the first step forward for protecting Florida's future,' said House Speaker Jon Mills, D-Gainesville, according to a Tampa Bay Times account (then the St. Petersburg Times). Someone had to be the 'adult in the room,' Frishe said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida, taking a jab against Brandes, 36, whom Frishe indirectly mocks in another commercial as 'a young wannabe politician, beating his chest, claiming to be a Reagan Republican.' A lobbying fight to repeal the tax emerged that summer, with the Florida Association of Broadcasters railing against it loudly. Martinez summoned lawmakers for a special session on the issue, and lawmakers repealed the services sales tax on Dec. 10, 1987, and replaced it with a one percent increase on the state sales tax on goods. Frishe voted against the measure. In the House Journal, which is an official record of the proceedings, Frishe explained his vote by saying that he supported repealing the tax on services, but he opposed raising the sales tax on goods.",,,,Says Jim Frishe wanted to 'tax us for doing our taxes' through an accountant.,supported,true,,politifact

It is sometimes identified as having been taken in the town of Coburg. Although nearly all of the subjects pictured were wearing white dresses and their outfits were clearly color-coordinated for the event, we found no evidence to support the contention that Nazi girls' or women's groups habitually dressed all in white for public occasions. In fact, a fair amount of photographic evidence indicates that they didn't. In the image below, for example, a contingent of Deutschen Jungmädel can be seen marching in a Nazi parade in the German city of Worms. A few are dressed in white, but most are wearing white blouses and dark skirts (according to Michael Hans Kater, a historian of Nazism and author of the 2009 book Hitler Youth, white blouses and navy-blue skirts were their standard attire): German Federal Archive / Wikimedia Commons Similarly, we ran across more historical photographs of the National Socialist Women's League showing its members wearing outfits of various light and dark colors than we found showing them dressed entirely in white. Finally, even if it were true that a Nazi women's organization whose members always wore white to public events did exist, nothing links such a group - historically, ideologically, or symbolically - to the democratically-elected female members of the U.S. Congress who donned white on a few specific occasions for the stated purpose of honoring the suffragists. Nazism was the antithesis of what these women, not to mention their early 20th century forerunners who paved the way for their ascent to elective office, represent.",Does This Photo Show White-Clad Members of the League of Nazi Socialist Women?

8766,13743,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lyft-legal-aid-texas-abortion/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the implementation of a controversial Texas state law that effectively bans most abortions, prompting an outraged response among Democrats, pro-choice activists, celebrities, and some sectors of corporate America. Texas Senate Bill (S.B.) 8, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on May 19 and implemented on Sept. 1, bans any and all abortions after the 'first detectable heartbeat' of a fetus, an event that can take place as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows a private citizen to sue any woman who undergoes an abortion after this point, or anyone who assists her, regardless of whether the citizen has any personal connection to those individuals. According to a widely shared Facebook post, one of the major U.S. companies to announce its opposition to the law was the ride-sharing app Lyft. On Sept. 4, Facebook user Izabella Kordalewski posted what appeared to be a screenshot of a letter from the company, addressed to 'Lyft riders and drivers,' criticizing S.B. 8 as 'incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy.' The letter also promised to provide financial assistance to Lyft drivers who become caught up in the enforcement of the law by transporting women who are on their way to obtain an abortion, in potential violation of S.B. 8. Kordalewski introduced the letter by writing, 'Dear friends. Here is a screenshot of an email I received from Lyft yesterday. Go make good choices.' The letter itself read as follows: Dear Lyft Riders and Drivers, A new Texas law, SB8, threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go - specifically, women exercising their right to choose and to access the healthcare they need. We want to be clear: Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly, riders never have to justify, or even share, where they are going and why. Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable. This law is incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company. We are taking action on two fronts: Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. Riders and Drivers: Nothing about how you drive, ride or interact with each other should change. TX SB8 is an attack on women's right to choose. Lyft is donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to help ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. If you feel compelled to join us as an individual, you can make a donation here. That letter was entirely authentic, so we are issuing a rating of 'True.' On Sept. 3, Lyft shared the letter on its own website, stipulating that it was signed by co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, as well as the company's general counsel, Kristin Sverchek.

According to state and federal figures, that was so in each of the five months preceding Patrick's radio interview. It's worth noting that when apprehensions sufficiently decrease -- as in six of the previous seven months -- this claim wouldn't hold. This claim was solid when Patrick spoke. We rate it True. TRUE - The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","State Sen. Dan Patrick put a numerical twist on the U.S.-Mexico border situation, saying that more border crossers are being apprehended than babies are being born in Texas. In a July 21, 2014, appearance on Laura Ingraham's radio program, Patrick, the 2014 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, said: 'Just two weeks ago, we apprehended almost 10,000 people crossing the border--in one week, Laura.' After explanation about those numbers, Patrick continued, 'If we apprehend eight or nine thousand a week, that's more people than are born in Texas each week.' Ingraham drew in her breath--and we wondered about Patrick's border apprehensions and Texas births comparison. To our inquiry, Patrick campaign spokesman Alejandro Garcia said by phone Patrick picked up on the comparison from a briefing by state officials when he was in the Rio Grande Valley in June 2014. The comparison, Garcia said, illustrates the seriousness of border apprehensions. By email, Garcia pointed us to a U.S. Border Patrol chart showing annual apprehensions in the Southwest Border sector, meaning the southern border running from Brownsville to San Diego. In the federal fiscal year that ran through September 2013, there were 414,397 apprehensions in the sector, counting 243,550 along the Texas portion of the border, according to the chart. (As we've noted before, an 'apprehension' is an arrest for being in the United States without authorization, but it's worth noting the number of people detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once.) Garcia also noted a Texas Department of State Health Services web page indicating that in 2010, 385,746 babies were born in the state So, U.S-Mexico border apprehensions in 2012-13 outnumbered Texas births in 2010. Up-to-date data Recognizing this information didn't enable an apples-to-apples comparison -- the births occurred three years before the apprehensions -- we looked for the latest available information on apprehensions and births. By email, Christine Mann of the Texas Department of State of Health Services gave us 'provisional' monthly birth tallies for 2013 and 2014. Separately, Doug Mosier, an El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman, provided a chart indicating monthly apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border from October 2012 through early September 2014. This enabled us to compare apprehensions and births by month for all of 2013 and the first six months of 2014. Result: Apprehensions outnumbered births in 11 of the 18 months including the latest months, February through June 2014. Texas births outnumbered apprehensions in January 2013; July through September 2013; and November 2013 through January 2014. For the sake of gauging Patrick's claim over the latest full year of data available when he spoke, we looked at totals covering July 2013 through June 2014. In those months, there were about 393,299 births in Texas, according to the state. Meantime, the Border Patrol tallied 480,404 apprehensions. But monthly apprehensions fluctuated considerably, ranging from a low of 28,671 in January 2014 to a high of 60,689 in May 2014 (when 17,888 apprehended immigrants were 17 years old or younger). Of note, Texas births outnumbered apprehensions in the border region in half the months, most recently January 2014 when the 33,089 births compared to 28,671 apprehensions. So, apprehensions outnumbered births in the 12 months by 87,105, or 22 percent. By our calculation, that is, there were an average of 9,213 weekly apprehensions and 7,543 Texas weekly births. Footnote: Apprehensions outnumbering Texas births looks like a new development. For instance in the federal fiscal year of 2012, 380,140 babies were born in Texas while the Border Patrol had 356,873 apprehensions near the southwestern border. The same was so in fiscal 2011, when 380,481 children were born in Texas and the Border Patrol apprehended 327,577. Divide that down into a weekly rate, and in both years, births in Texas outnumbered apprehensions along the Mexico border.",,,,More people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week 'than are born in Texas each week.,supported,true,,politifact

If you wanted to ski, you had to go to part of the world that receives ample snowfall. If you wanted to ice skate or play hockey, you had to be in a place where outdoor temperatures reliably remained below freezing. If you wanted to play baseball, you needed a fairly large, flat piece of land in an area with relatively dry and warmweather.Nowadays, however, modern technology has removed many of those restrictions. Refrigeration has made ice sports such as skating and hockey possible even in the warmest of climates. Domed stadiums and artificial turf allow team sports like baseball and football to be played indoors and in areas where the weather might ordinarily be too cold, too hot, or too inclement to comfortably allow it. Snow-manufacturing machines help ski runs operate even when natural snowfall might otherwise be too light for them to remain open. And, of course, all of these innovations remove not just restrictions of geography, but of the calendar as well - ice and snow eventually melt as seasons change, but indoor ice rinks can operate year-round.The ultimate in geography- and calendar-defeating mechanisms might be indoor ski slopes, facilities that make use of snow cannons and refrigeration to create and maintain snowy, climate-controlled conditions and provide skiers with at least some gentle slopes that can be enjoyed at any time of year, regardless of the weather outside. The first such facility was the Snowdome (formerly Mt. Thebarton), which opened in Adelaide, Australia, in 1987.Over a dozen additional indoor ski facilities have been constructed in various cities around the world in the last few decades, including the one shown in the photographs displayed above: Ski Dubai, a 22,500-square meter indoor skiing area boasting five slopes of varying difficulty, height, and steepness housed within the Mall of the Emirates in the city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (Other interior photos of the facility as well as additional pictures taken during its construction in 2005 can be found in the gallery section of the Ski Dubai web site.)Creating a facility that could maintain a 6,000-ton snow base and a constant -1°C to -2°C temperature in a desert climate such as Dubai's posed something of a formidable challenge, one which engineers met thusly:Ski Dubai has real snow. Snow is made using a simple procedure similar to how snow is artificially made at outdoor ski resorts. Pure water, with no chemicals added, is put through a chiller to cool. It is then sent through pipes to the snow guns which are on the ceiling. When the cooled water is blown out into a freezing cold environment, it crystallises and makes snow. The temperature during the time when snow is made is -7c to -8c. The final product is real snow, as if it came from nature. We just give it a little help. Our facility is specially designed as a massive cold box. The walls have numerous levels of insulation, and the roof is 5 metres higher than the ceiling, providing very efficient insulation. This makes Ski Dubai one of the best refrigerators in the world! We have 23 blast coolers (air conditioner type machines) that chill the air and maintain a temperature of -1c during operating hours. There are also kilometres of glycol tubing running through the floor (similar to the back of your refrigerator) that chill the snow, keeping the base of the snow solid, and 30 tons of fresh snow are made daily to cover the base.Additional information: Dubai Desert Gives Way to Ski Resort (Aljazeera)",Ski Dubai,Do photographs show an indoor skiing facility in the desert?,,Photographs show an indoor skiing facility in the desert city of Dubai.,supported,True.,"<p>Ski Dubai has real snow.

30282,114939,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/12/tom-harkin/can-employers-actually-pay-disabled-americans-belo/, ,0,0,,,"Our ruling Harkin said, 'Employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage.' He's right that employers have been able to pay a subminimum wage to disabled workers since the 1930s. There's one significant exception today, created by Obama's executive order: Federal contractors must pay all workers a $10.15 minimum wage. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf683287-e597-4fcc-9926-102ddec70249","Many speakers at this year's Democratic National Convention focused on Hillary Clinton's desire to help all people, including women, the gay and lesbian community, and racial minorities. Former Sen. Tom Harkin used his speech to focus on Americans with disabilities. 'Twenty-six years ago today, our nation won a hard-fought battle to end discrimination for over 50 million people when we signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA,' Harkin stated. However, he continued, 'when, 26 years later, employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage, it is time to change that law. Hillary Clinton will fight to eliminate the subminimum wage, and ensure that a fair day's work earns a fair day's pay.' Are employers actually able to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage? We took a look. The Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, of 1990 is the most comprehensive piece of legislation that safeguards the rights and interests of disabled Americans. Title I of the ADA protects qualified individuals from employment discrimination. It applies to private-sector employers employing more than 15 individuals, as well as to employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor/management committees. Employers are also required to make reasonable accommodation, which means making any change or adjustment that allows disabled people to partake in all functions of the job process. The ADA also protects disabled individuals from discrimination in pay. Employers cannot make up the cost of reasonable accommodation by reducing a disabled individual's pay lower than the pay of others in the same position. Subminimum wage provisions While the ADA does protect individuals from pay discrimination, the protection is qualified. Under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employers are able to pay a wage below the federal minimum wage to workers whose work is affected by a mental or physical deficiency. (The ADA does not change this provision.) The reduction in wage corresponds to the reduction in productivity as compared with a worker without a disability. This means that some disabled workers can make significantly less than the minimum wage, in some cases even less than a dollar per hour. Employers must obtain a certificate from the Wage and Hour Division to set a wage below the federal minimum. According to the U.S. Labor Department, the certificate program has been implemented in the employment of over 420,000 disabled Americans. This reduced wage, known as the subminimum wage, has been in effect since the 1930s, with several changes over the years. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933-1935 set the first productivity-based subminimum wage, which was adopted again with the passing of the FLSA in 1938. The subminimum wage had a wage floor until 1986. Since then, the subminimum wage has been commensurate with productivity. Executive Order 13658 In 2014, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13658, which established a minimum wage for workers working on or under a contract with the federal government. The order specifically included disabled workers under purview of section 14(c) of the FLSA. While the executive order requires that all workers working on or under contracts of the federal government be paid a minimum of $10.15 per hour, the order did not inhibit the use of commensurate wages. Employers are still able to pay disabled individuals less than other workers as long as the wage remains at or above the $10.15 minimum. Furthermore, the executive order only applies to work in association with the federal government. The order's limited scope and qualification of commensurate pay has made many disability advocates call for more far-reaching reform. Calls for more reform Many disability advocates claim that the subminimum wage is antiquated and fosters systemic inequities. In an article for the Huffington Post in 2015, Curtis Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, wrote that the subminimum wage was an incentive for businesses to hire physically disabled individuals in the competitive manufacturing industries of the time. However, the provision is exploited today because 'unscrupulous employers eager to profit off the cheap labor ... portray their business as a 'job training' program.' Disabled Americans enter these programs under the assumption that they will gain valuable skills that will lead to real-world jobs and financial independence. However, Decker said this rarely happens because 'as soon as the worker becomes proficient in one area and ready to graduate, they change that person's task.' Many never graduate from the program and are stuck making subminimum wages while employers benefit from the cheap labor. We reached out to the Clinton and Trump campaigns for insight on their respective plans regarding disability policy. The Clinton campaign directed us to a March 25, 2016, speech in which she discussed the subminimum wage. 'I want us to take a hard look at raising the minimum wage and ending the tiered minimum wages, whether it's for people with disabilities or the tipped wage,' Clinton said. (Another group of people who can be paid below the minimum wage are those, such as restaurant servers, whose income comes to a significant degree from customer tips.) The Trump campaign did not respond to our inquiries, and there is no disability policy agenda detailed on the official campaign website.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2020 Shortly afterwards, a meme circulated via social media presented Trump's words as a perfect echo of a passage in a speech given by German dictator Adolf Hitler some eighty years earlier, in which the latter supposedly proclaimed, 'Dies ist ein Kampf um die Rettung des Erbes, der Geschichte und der Größe unseres Landes!': However, this statement - as worded here - is not a documented utterance of Hitler's. It appears that someone just ran the wording of Trump's tweet through Google Translate and attributed the result to Hitler, as references to this phrasing are not found elsewhere and only appeared on the internet at the same time the meme itself did. Hitler did give a speech on Jan. 30, 1939, the infamous Reichstag Speech in which he warned 'the German public and the world that the outbreak of war would mean the end of European Jewry.' During that speech, Hitler did talk of the importance of preserving Germany and its culture, but he did not phrase that concept as succinctly as presented in the meme, and he was primarily speaking out against the incursion of foreigners and Jews into German territory and government, not warning against an internecine domestic battle over German heritage and history: The German nation does not wish its interests to be determined and controlled by any foreign nation.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 9, 2018 Trump's figures match up with international trade data. But economists raised some important details that Trump omitted from his tweet, which put his claim in a slightly different light. Trump's numbers are correct Trump's numbers are drawn from American and Chinese government trade data. The United States does, in fact, pay a 25 percent tariff on cars sent to China, whereas China pays only 2.5 percent on cars coming into the United States So the numerical portion of Trump's claim is correct. But experts said his statement leaves out context. China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports For starters, China exports very few cars to the United States. China accounted for about 3 out of every 10,000 cars sold in the United States last year, according to Michael Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. 'For every car we import from China, we export six to China. None of those Chinese-produced cars is branded by a Chinese company (it is mostly Volvo),' Hicks said. 'Our auto industry is doing extraordinarily well in China, while Chinese car production limps along.' To illustrate China's relatively low share of car exports to the United States, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, pointed out data on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States, Mexico and Canada impose no tariffs. Here's a side-by-side look at China, and the United States' NAFTA trade partners: 'China exports very few cars to the U.S. So Trump's Tweet is once again a bit of a red herring,' said Bown, who noted that a similar disparity exists when comparing Chinese car exports to the European Union, Japan or South Korea. Cherry-picking? Some experts suggested Trump had cherry-picked the facts by singling out 'cars' instead of a broader category of automobiles or car parts. For instance, the U.S. tariff on light trucks from China is 25 percent. That import duty is a legacy tariff that dates back to a trade dispute in the 1960s between the United States and several European countries, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. 'So by choosing 'cars' but not 'trucks' in his Twitter example, Trump is cherry-picking products and not telling the entire story,' said Bown, of the Peterson Institute. Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute, noted that Chinese tariffs on American auto parts sent to China are well below 25 percent. For example, China places a 10 percent tariff on automobile engines. That's significant because 'U.S. firms often ship auto parts to China to be assembled there,' Hufbauer added. Hicks, of Ball State University, noted that the trade disparity stems in part from Trump's decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era deal to lower trade barriers among a dozen countries. 'So, had he not killed the TPP, whatever tariff distortions which now exist would have been reduced,' Hicks said.",,,,"'When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%.

Indeed, that fact has given rise to a number of tales about checks written on surfaces other than paper: A check doesn't necessarily have to be written on paper. There are legends, probably apocryphal, of checks written on the backs of shirts (by tax protesters) and on watermelon rinds (by goodness knows whom - maybe madcap farmers), even on skin. If they were written in the right format, they could be cashed. [A check] can be written on anything. As long as it has the elements, the surface doesn't make a difference. A check is an order to pay someone, that's all it is. 'It has to contain certain features, and it can be written on anything,' says Brian Black, managing director of operations and technology for the Bank Administration Institute. 'As long as it has the elements, the surface doesn't make a difference. A check is an order to pay someone, that's all it is.' In that vein, the story of the check written on the side of a cow is so widespread that major banks reportedly make reference to it in pamphlets given out to new depositors as an example of some of the unusual things people have used as checks. Nonetheless, it's a completely fabricated tale, and it sprang straight from the adventures of one Albert Haddock, the fictitious and fanciful creation of British writer A.P. Herbert. Herbert's book Uncommon Law was first published in 1935. Herbert himself was called to the English Bar but never practiced, choosing another career path instead. He was a regular contributor to Punch for more than fifty years and the author of eight novels. He became a member of Parliament in 1935 and fought successfully for the reform of many licensing, divorce, and obscenity laws. Okay, now you know a bit about the author. As for his wondrous creation, Albert Haddock, here's a bit from the introduction to Uncommon Law: Albert Haddock made his first public appearance in Punch about 1924. I have always understood that I invented him, but he has made some disturbing escapes into real life. The first of the first series of Misleading Cases shown by the BBC on television in 1967 was No. 32 'Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock' where Haddock, in payment of income tax, made out a cheque on a cow and led it to the office of the Collector of Taxes. Some weeks later I received a spacious cutting from an American newspaper (the Memphis Press-Scimitar) headed: A CHECK CAN BE WRITTEN ON A COW The article made not the slightest reference to me, my work, or the BBC, but used as news all Haddock's arguments and opinions on unconventional cheques. Halfway through, it suddenly claimed the authority of the Chase Manhattan Bank for the particular case of the cow: 'In the 19th century an Englishman named Albert Haddock got mad at the local tax collector over his bill and conceived a most ingenious idea for getting even.' Then followed the whole story. 19th century indeed! Haddock wasn't a real person any more than Sherlock Holmes was. A.P. Herbert loved writing about the law, so he created Haddock as an ongoing character upon whom he could hang his fanciful stories. The BBC's Misleading Cases comedy series, based on the exploits of the fictional Albert Haddock, used this one of Herbert's tales for its premier episode ('The Negotiable Cow,' originally aired 20 June 1967), and someone at the Memphis Press-Scimitar picked up on it, didn't get the joke, and presented it as something that really happened. Not content to leave well enough alone, the Press-Scimitar threw in the bit about the Chase Manhattan Bank to lend an extra bit of believability to the tale. One wonders how many cattle have been led into the Chase Manhattan Bank over the years thanks to the Press-Scimitar's gullibility. (NOTE: A number of Internet sources cite the 1985 edition of Michael Liepner's Applying the Law as documentation of the claim that 'In Canada during the 1930s, a farmer painted a cheque on the side of a cow and cashed it.' This citation is erroneous: the referenced book contains no such statement.)Recent Updates ","Did Someone Once Write a Check on the Side of a Cow?

When it was posted to her 500px photography page in 2013, it was tagged with the keywords 'manipulation,' 'fake,' and 'photoshop.' Although this image was digitally manipulated, at least one podiatrist truly does perform 'Cinderella procedures.' However, the results of these cosmetic foot surgeries are not nearly as extreme as those shown above - it is a surgery to remove bunions. The New York Times reported in 2014: For Dr. Sadrieh (who was wearing made-to-order Gucci brogues), foot surgery is a fusion of medicine and fairy tale. At his practice, you don't have a bunionectomy; you have a Cinderella procedure. 'I had never met a patient who asked for a hallux valgus correction with osteotomy and screw fixation,' he said. 'So I decided to create a name that captures the result of the procedure, without all the Latin. The point of the Cinderella: being able to put a shoe on that didn't fit comfortably before. He also has coined the Perfect 10! (aesthetic toe-shortening - once administered, he said, to a 17-year-old fashion model, so she could wear the shoes her career demanded); Model T (toe-lengthening); and Foot Tuck, a fat-pad augmentation that he said helps with high heels. Pernille's artwork likely started to become associated with 'Cinderella Surgery' shortly after the New York TImes piece on Sadrieh came out. When the web site Health 24 News later published an article on the same topic, this doctored image was predominantly featured. Pernille wasn't the first to imagine a woman's foot morphing into a high heel shoe made of flesh and bone. Artist Julie Rapp's created a similar image in 2001 for a piece called 'Overstepping': The morphing of shoe and foot that Julie Rrap has made in Overstepping exaggerate the implants, injections and surgical enhancements which have reshaped the female form today. Her high-heeled feet represent a possible endpoint for the idea of the malleable and fashionable body, aimed at the true fashion victim.

Those queries were very similar to ones we had received a month earlier about a similar spate of false rumors about many A-list celebrities' choosing to move to small towns in the U.S. and Canada, having tired of Hollywood's phoniness and fallen in love with the little slices of Heaven found in smaller and quieter communities. The articles all feature a revolving list of celebrities (e.g., Matthew McConaughey, Patrick Dempsey, Bill Murray, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler, Harrison Ford, Will Ferrell) purportedly talking about a variety of towns across the U.S. (e.g., Mustang, Oklahoma; Marion, Illinois; Rochester, New Hampshire; Pflugerville, Texas; Marion, Ohio). Like the 'celebrity moving' to a small town hoaxes, all these snippets of entertainment news came from what appeared to be just two websites: WLEB 21 and WCPM 3 News (both used 'local news source' as tag lines, without specifying precisely just where the sites were local to). Again, either a very untrustworthy tire dealer was operating somewhere in Los Angeles, or these two brand new sites were novel social media prank generators aimed at attracting traffic through reams of localized shares. The two web sites are virtually identical in appearance: And the similarities between the sites aren't solely stylistic - the celebrity experiences they report are also implausibly identical: Hollywood actor Tom Hanks passed through Canton, Ohio recently and apparently was quite impressed with the residents there. In an interview this week Hanks said: 'Well, we had a flat tire just as we were about to leave the city limits of Canton and two, maybe three cars pulled over within five minutes to help us with it. And no, they had no idea who I was before they pulled over. They were very helpful and very friendly. I gotta say, I was really impressed with the people of Canton, Ohio! That would've never happened in L.A.!' Hollywood actor Harrison Ford passed through San Angelo, Texas recently and apparently was quite impressed with the residents there. In an interview this week Ford said: 'Well, we had a flat tire just as we were about to leave the city limits of San Angelo and two, maybe three cars pulled over within five minutes to help us with it. And no, they had no idea who I was before they pulled over. They were very helpful and very friendly. I gotta say, I was really impressed with the people of San Angelo, Texas! That would've never happened in L.A.!' Hollywood actor Will Ferrell passed through Harlingen, Texas recently and apparently was quite impressed with the residents there. In an interview this week Ferrell said: 'Well, we had a flat tire just as we were about to leave the city limits of Harlingen and two, maybe three cars pulled over within five minutes to help us with it. And no, they had no idea who I was before they pulled over. They were very helpful and very friendly. I gotta say, I was really impressed with the people of Harlingen, Texas! That would've never happened in L.A.!' Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks were among celebrities so purportedly unfortunate that they experienced flat tires in multiple small towns (but fortunate in that all those areas were home to very helpful residents): WCPM 3 News and WLEB 21 also bear disclaimers identical to each other and to those of the two sites that were behind the 'celebrity moving to a small town' rumors (Headline Brief and McKenzie Post): WCPM 3 News is a fantasy news site. All news articles on wcpm3.com are satire or pure fantasy. WLEB 21 is a fantasy news site. All news articles on wleb21.com are satire or pure fantasy. McKenzie Post, Headline Brief, WCPM 3 News, and WLEB 21 were very similar to the prank generator FeedNewz, the primary purpose of which is user submission of fake news stories for sharing among social media friends. Social media users eagerly to share these seemingly relevant items, in turn driving traffic to the sites and boosting their bottom lines. While sharing the phony news reports causes no direct harm to readers, the trend contributes to a social media climate encouraging hoax purveyors through financial incentives. Variations: In August 2017, the hoax received a minor makeover. Instead of geotargeting social media users, fake news purveyors leveraged religious networks to rack up share counts. Iterations with titles such as 'What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons' or 'What Matthew McConaughey is saying about Mormons' began circulating on social media: Actor Matthew McConaughey's comments about the Mormon religion is one of the top stories today with the actor defending Mormons against an interviewer who made disparaging comments about them. The interview took place on a podcast earlier today when the subject of religion came up. The interviewer, who is an atheist, was making fun of religion in general but when he began to disparage Mormons in particular, McConaughey stepped in: 'I don't know, Ben, I don't think I've ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you're just having some fun here but - from my experience - Mormons are some of the most decent people I've ever come across. Some of my neighbors, growing up, were Mormon and they were ideal neighbors, ya know? Their kids were like really, really nice and well-behaved and all of that. Honestly, I don't know how you could say anything negative about them? And every Mormon I've ever met since that time has been just like that. I'm not even saying anything about their religion. I'm just saying that they're obviously doing some right, ok!' McConaughey said laughing.

Charlie Crist's past positions as a Republican lawmaker are being brought back to light as Crist seeks to return to elected office as a Democrat. Crist is challenging incumbent Rep. David Jolly, R-Belleair Bluffs, for Florida's 13th Congressional District, which includes Pinellas County at the western edge of Florida's pivotal I-4 corridor. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he'd rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist's proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s. Jolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida's first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. 'You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight,' Jolly said to Crist. Jolly closed by asking, 'Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?' Crist said 'it was beneath' Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time. 'In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America,' Crist said. 'The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds,' Crist added. In a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly's story about Crist's visit to Alabama. Here, we are looking at Crist's rebuttal. When it comes to the facts, Crist is correct on both statistics. Crist's campaign directed us to data from the Disaster Center, which used FBI Uniform Crime Reports to compare violent crime across states. The data shows from 1991 to 1997, Florida was ranked No. 1 for the rate of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. To calculate the rate of violent crime, you take the total number for each of the violent crime categories (murder, rape, robbery and assault) for every 100,000 population in that year. In 1998, Florida was ranked No. 2., with New Mexico earning the top spot. The number of violent crimes decreased in Florida throughout the 1990s, mirroring a national trend. As for Crist's other statistic, it was actually happening more often than he said for most of the decade. The year 1993 marked Crist's first year in the Florida Senate and a record-high amount of violent crimes (161,789). According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, a violent crime happened every three minutes and 14 seconds. The figure stretched to three minutes and 19 seconds in 1994, and then to three minutes and 28 seconds in 1995. In 1998, violent crimes were occurring every three minutes and 45 seconds - what Crist said. In 2015, violent crimes happened every five minutes and 37 seconds.",,,,"'In the mid 1990s, in our state, (Florida was) No. 1 in violent crime in America. ...

'And while other states that failed to act saw electricity rates jump 70 percent,' Strickland said, 'Ohio's electricity rates are 10 percent below the national average.' Strickland's spokeswoman, Allison Kolodziej, acknowledges that Ohio's electricity rates were already well below the national average before Strickland took office in January 2007. But she said the governor's push for Senate Bill 221 - which became law in 2008 and placed tighter reins on utility companies seeking to set market-based pricing - prevented Ohio's rates from skyrocketing as rates did in other states where wholesale market pricing was unchecked. The question: Are Ohio's rates today a full 10 percent below the national average as the governor claimed? The governor's campaign staff said it relied on information from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, or EIA, for its figures. According to EIA's most recent average retail price report, released June 16 and updated through March, Ohio's average electricity price for all sectors this year was 8.72 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average was 9.5 cents. That means Ohio's rate thus for 2010 for all sectors is about 8 percent below the national average - not 10 percent. In 2009, however - the last full year of available figures - Ohio's average was 8.63 cents per kilowatt hour and the national average 9.75 cents, meaning a year ago the state was 11 percent below the national average. That means Strickland's statement is not accurate today but was a year ago. Kolodziej said the campaign is relying on 2009 figures because the full 2010 year figures are not yet complete. The premise of Strickland's statement is that Ohio is still trending below the national average when it comes to electricity rates, and thus is better off than many other states in terms of utility costs. The context of his point was accurate.

But she said the governor's push for Senate Bill 221 - which became law in 2008 and placed tighter reins on utility companies seeking to set market-based pricing - prevented Ohio's rates from skyrocketing as rates did in other states where wholesale market pricing was unchecked. The question: Are Ohio's rates today a full 10 percent below the national average as the governor claimed? The governor's campaign staff said it relied on information from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, or EIA, for its figures. According to EIA's most recent average retail price report, released June 16 and updated through March, Ohio's average electricity price for all sectors this year was 8.72 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average was 9.5 cents. That means Ohio's rate thus for 2010 for all sectors is about 8 percent below the national average - not 10 percent. In 2009, however - the last full year of available figures - Ohio's average was 8.63 cents per kilowatt hour and the national average 9.75 cents, meaning a year ago the state was 11 percent below the national average. That means Strickland's statement is not accurate today but was a year ago. Kolodziej said the campaign is relying on 2009 figures because the full 2010 year figures are not yet complete. The premise of Strickland's statement is that Ohio is still trending below the national average when it comes to electricity rates, and thus is better off than many other states in terms of utility costs. The context of his point was accurate. But while the full 2010 figures are not yet available, there were more up to date figures the governor could have relied on during his speech that, while not as flattering as 2009, could have still effectively made his point - just more accurately.

One of the most storied events of the ship's tragic sinking (and one of the most famous scenes from James Cameron's 1997 movie 'Titanic') involves a group of musicians that continued to play as the ship began its descent into the icy waters: In April 2021, around the anniversary of the ship's sinking, a photograph was circulated on social media supposedly showing the violin that the band's leader, Wallace Hartley, had played aboard the Titanic: This is a genuine image of Hartley's violin. Hartley, unfortunately, as well as the other seven members of the Titanic's orchestra, perished during the disaster along with more than 1,500 other passengers (out of an estimated 2,224 people on board). Hartley's body was found 10 days after the ship's sinking and according to some accounts the violin was strapped to his body. The instrument would soon make it to Hartley's fiancee, Maria Robinson, who would keep it until her death in 1939. The violin changed hands a few times after that, then sat largely forgotten in an attic in England for decades until it was discovered again in 2006. A seven-year investigation ensued until the violin was officially authenticated as Hartley's Titanic violin. In 2013, it was sold at auction for $1,454,400, making it the most valuable artifact recovered from the Titanic. Here's how the Titanic Museum Attraction in Branson, Missouri, where the violin has been periodically displayed since 2013, describes the instrument's journey from Hartley's hands to auction: The band and their courageous act of continuing to play 'Nearer My God To Thee' in the midst of the frantic and hectic activity taking place all around them as the doomed ship gradually sank into her frigid watery grave was described by one newspaper at the time as an act that 'Will rank among the noblest in the annals of heroism at sea' and has played a pivotal role in the memory of that horrific night in books, movies and other depictions of the event. News accounts indicate that Hartley's body was found floating 10 days after the sinking with his violin in his leather valise, with some jewelry, strapped to his chest above his life vest. There is general agreement that it was returned to Maria Robinson, who was Hartley's fiancée and had given it to him in 1910 when they became engaged. Reports indicate that after her death in 1939 the violin was given to 'a Major Renwick of the Bridlington Salvation Army' who then gave it to a violin teacher who gave it to the mother of the current owner, in whose family it has been in for the last 70 years, many of them in an attic, until it was discovered by her son in 2006 when he found it in a leather case with the initials 'WHH' engraved on it. He, while remaining anonymous, turned it over to the auction house of Henry Aldridge and Son of Wiltshire, England, because of their expertise in dealing with Titanic artifacts and memorabilia, for authenticity. That process has taken a number of years and involved both extensive forensic testing of the violin and its silver engraved plate reading 'For Wallace on the occasion of our engagement from Maria' as well as the examination of a trail of documentary evidence. The results have led experts to much the same conclusion as that expressed by Craig Sopin, owner of one of the largest private Titanic collections of artifacts and memorabilia. He said, 'To say that I was skeptical at first would be an understatement. But after I conducted an exhaustively detailed investigation into the history and forensics of the instrument, I became convinced beyond a doubt that this violin belonged to Wallace Hartley and that is was with him on the Titanic.' Although this violin truly belonged to Wallace Hartley and was truly being played as the Titanic sank to its watery grave, there is some dispute about what song Hartley and the other band members played during this disaster. The most common claim (and the one featured in the movie 'Titanic') is that Hartley and the band played the hymn 'Nearer, My God, To Thee' as the ship sank. A 1912 newspaper clipping notes that this song was also played at Hartley's funeral: 19 May 1912, Sun The Washington Post (Washington, District of Columbia) Newspapers.com However, other accounts claim that the final song played aboard the Titanic was 'Autumn.' We took a deeper look into the Titanic band's final song here.","Was This Violin Played on the Titanic?

13414,381,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/heart-attacks-and-water/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"A missive touting a regimen that calls for the ingestion of four glasses of water first thing in the morning followed by the restriction of drinking after meals began circulating on the Internet in August 2004. While it now arrives primarily labeled 'Heart Attacks and Water,' its earliest appearances were titled 'Drinking Water as Treatment' and 'Drink Water on Empty Stomach': It is popular in Japan today to drink water immediately after waking up every morning. Furthermore, scientific tests have proven its value. We publish below a description of use of water for our readers. For old and serious diseases as well as modern illnesses the water treatment had been found successful by a Japanese medical society as a hundred percent cure for the following diseases, Headache, body ache, heart system, arthritis, fast heart beat, epilepsy, excess fatness, bronchitis, asthma, TB, Meningtitis, Kidney and Urine diseases, vomiting gastritis, diarrhoea, piles, diabetes, constipation, all eye diseases, womb cancer and menstrual disorders, ear nose and throat diseases. METHOD OF TREATMENT 1. As you wake up in the morning before brushing teeth, drink four glasses of water each of 160 ml. 2. Brush and clean the mouth but do not eat or drink anything for 45 minutes. 3. After 45 minutes you may eat and drink as normal. 4. After 15 minutes of breakfast, lunch and dinner do not eat or drink anything for two hours. 5. Those who are old or sick and are unable to drink four glasses of water at the beginning may commence by taking little water and gradually increase it to four glasses per day. 6. The above method of treatment will cure diseases of the sick and others can enjoy a healthy life. The following list gives the number of days of treatment required to cure main diseases. 1. High Blood Pressure 30 days 2. Gastric 10 days 3. Diabetes 30 days 4. Constipation 10 days 5. Cancer 180 days 6. TB 90 days Arthritis patients should follow the above treatment for only 3 days in the first week to be followed by daily treatment. This treatment method has no side effects, however at the commencement of treatment you may have to urinate a few times. Our earliest sighting of this item came from a message board post, where it was presented without any comment identifying its author. Its central claims to authority, that 'scientific tests have proven its value' and 'water treatment had been found successful by a Japanese medical society as a hundred percent cure for [various diseases]' are unsupported; we were unable to locate any record of 'scientific tests' proving this hypothesis, nor of statements issued in support of it by a 'Japanese medical society.' Diabetes, cancer, and tuberculosis are serious illnesses that are not subject to being easily cured by even the latest medical technologies, let alone by tap water. Belief in such easy fixes is understandable because such diseases are big, mean, scary things, and those so afflicted often feel powerless in the face of them. Of the illnesses included on the proffered list, the only malady that might be improved by increasing one's daily water intake is constipation; however, even that claim may be nothing more than chimera. The National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse says of the practice of increasing fluid intake in an effort to treat constipation that: Research shows that although increased fluid intake does not necessarily help relieve constipation, many people report some relief from their constipation if they drink fluids such as water and juice and avoid dehydration. Liquids add fluid to the colon and bulk to stools, making bowel movements softer and easier to pass. Claims that certain healthful benefits can be gained by eating or drinking particular items at specified times of the day are not new; such belief in ritual underpins, for example, the 'Eat fruit only on an empty stomach' e-mail. Likewise, the belief that increasing one's water intake would be a good and healthful thing to do is also well traveled; many people continue to believe (erroneously, it turns out) that 75% of Americans are 'chronically dehydrated' and that to stay healthy folks must drink eight glasses of water a day. In January 2010, we happened upon another 'benefits of drinking water' e-mail which by November 2011 had been expanded into this longer form: Heart Attack & Water I asked my Doctor why do I and other people urinate (pee) so much at night time. Answer from my Cardiac Doctor = Gravity holds water in the lower part of your body when you are upright. When you lie down and the lower body (legs and other things) seeks level with the kidneys it is then that the kidneys remove the water because it is easier. This then ties in with the last statement! I knew you need your minimum water to help flush the toxins out of your body, but this was news to me. Correct time to drink water... very Important. From A Cardiac Specialist! Drinking water at a certain time maximizes its effectiveness on the body: 2 glasses of water after waking up - helps activate internal organs 1 glass of water 30 minutes before a meal - helps digestion 1 glass of water before taking a bath - helps lower blood pressure 1 glass of water before going to bed - avoids stroke or heart attack Please pass this to the people you care about...... I can also add to this... My Physician told me that water at bed time will also help prevent night time leg cramps. Your leg muscles are seeking hydration when they cramp and wake you up with a Charlie Horse. The suggestion that a glass of water 'helps digestion' is nebulous (how would that be measured?), the claim that it 'helps lower blood pressure' is erroneous, and the statement that water 'activates internal organs' in the morning is misleading (our organs function quite well all on their own while we sleep, and they continue functioning after we wake up). The one potentially true bit of information related to this item is that some studies have suggested a higher daily intake of water may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Later versions of this piece also tacked on an older item about taking aspirin at the first sign of a heart attack.",Heart Attacks and Water Drinking four glasses of water at the beginning of each day will not prevent heart attacks and cure all sorts of diseases.

Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down.' Scott didn't act alone -- he signed the law after the Legislature passed it in 2011. The bill didn't flat out prevent doctors from asking patients if they owned a gun, but said they should refrain from asking about guns unless they believed in good faith the information was relevant to the patient's medical care or safety. That was a vague standard, which effectively silenced some doctors, critics claimed. A federal appeals court ruled in 2017 that the inquiry provisions prevented medical professionals from asking questions about firearms. The ruling also stated that doctors faced the threat of discipline and doctors must be able to speak openly with patients to provide life-saving information. As a result of these caveats, we rate this statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9660f570-cb4f-4f06-97ce-8a7ea1223c48","A TV ad airing in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting targets Florida Gov. Rick Scott over his support for a controversial gun measure. The ad was produced by Giffords, an organization that fights gun violence and is named for former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords was shot in the head in 2011. The ad references three recent Florida shootings, in Parkland, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, and then goes after Scott. 'We need to stop dangerous people from getting guns. But Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down.' Does the ad cast Scott's position, and the reaction of the court, correctly? We decided to find out. The law behind the ad, 'docs vs. glocks' In 2011, Florida lawmakers crafted a bill to strengthen patient protection related to firearms after hearing a report of a woman in Central Florida who was turned away from her pediatrician. The bill said that health care providers couldn't ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider 'believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.' It also stated that health care providers couldn't discriminate against patients because they own firearms. The penalties included facing fines up to $10,000 or loss of a medical license. The bill passed the House and Senate, with a few Democrats joining in with Republicans to support the plan. Scott signed the bill into law on June 2, 2011. The ad correctly says the law applied to a 'mental health professional' because Florida law defines health care practitioners as including those who are licensed to provide psychological, clinical, counseling, and psychotherapy services. But did the law make it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun? The 2011 law didn't expressly state that doctors couldn't ask patients if they owned a gun. But it did limit their ability to do so by stating that providers 'should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm' unless in 'good faith' they believe 'that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry.' The law failed to detail what would qualify as meeting that standard. Critics say it created a chilling effect for doctors who stopped asking questions out of fear they would face discipline. Court struck down some provisions as unconstitutional After nearly six years of litigation, in February 2017 the 11th Circuit Federal Appeals Court ruled that some provisions of the law were unconstitutional, including the part that prevented providers from asking patients about guns. The bill's 'record-keeping and inquiry provisions prevent doctors and medical professionals from asking all patients, or all patients with children, whether they own firearms or have firearms in their homes, or from recording answers to such questions.' A medical professional, for example, would violate the law 'if he or she gives all new patients an intake questionnaire which asks about firearms in the home,' the court wrote. 'This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down.' The ruling addressed the danger of the law in a few ways. First, the court addressed the danger of doctors facing a 'credible threat of prosecution.' The court wrote that when the alleged danger of legislation is self-censorship harm, 'can be realized even without an actual prosecution.' Second, the court concluded that the legislation did not provide a means by which patients could hear from their doctors about firearms and firearm safety. In the fields of medicine and public health 'information can save lives' and doctors, therefore, 'must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients,' the court wrote. The court wrote that some medical organizations believe that unsecured firearms increase risks of injuries and are a leading cause of death for some age groups. That's why major medical groups 'recommend that doctors and pediatricians routinely ask patients about firearm ownership, and educate them about the dangers posed to children by firearms that are not safely secured.' Thomas Julin, a First Amendment lawyer who represented a coalition of medical groups as 'friends of the court,' told PolitiFact that the court was not attempting to determine whether the law was so dangerous that it had to strike it down. 'It was trying to determine whether the state had sufficient evidence to show that the law would advance the interests that it supposedly had been enacted to serve,' he wrote. However, the law did create a danger that health care providers would censor their own speech -- which they did do to avoid possible discipline. 'When one speaks of the law being dangerous, I think most people would understand that to mean not simply that it created a danger of self-censorship, but that the law deterred health care providers from providing advice to patients that would be used to prevent firearm accidents,' Julin said. 'I think that is a fair characterization of what the law likely did because it apparently did deter health care providers not only from making inquiries of their patients but also from providing advice to their patients regarding the dangers of firearms and ammunition ownership and how that could be mitigated.' We asked Scott's press office if he had any evidence to refute the claims in the ad, but his spokeswoman did not directly answer our question and said that Scott was 'focused on finding real solutions to keep students safe.' Scott showed support when the Legislature passed the bills. 'I look forward to seeing those bills,' Scott said in April 2011. 'I believe in the right to bear arms.'",,,,"'Gov.

This report shows just how bad it has gotten at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency recently endorsed Donald Trump, and now we know why. Federal U.S. Agents working on the border in immigration facilities have detained over 6,000 Islamic aliens. Conservative Tribune confirmed this in a recent report on the state of our crumbling borders. Adam Isacson, An analyst at the Washington Office in Latin America pointed out the specific location the jihadists where able to enter from. The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged this glaringly weak area of Tapachula in the past, yet has failed to take any real action. It is an area that terrorist groups could easily use to funnel in weapons, ammunition, drugs, and sex slaves. For starters, Tapachula lies on Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, not on the U.S.-Mexico border. Further, there is no 'official report' or credible media report that 6,000 'Islamic aliens' have been detained by U.S. agents. The information was apparently gleaned from conservative web sites such as Breitbart and the Conservative Tribune, both of which used misleading headlines (Breitbart: 'Thousands of Middle Eastern Illegal Immigrants Busted With Forged Papers at Border; Conservative Tribune: '6,000 Muslims Cross Southern Border, All Caught With 1 Alarming Item). Both publications cribbed their stories from a report by Reuters that did not report what those sites claimed. According to Reuters, U.S. agents had been sent to Mexico's southern border to vet 640 migrants from countries outside the Americas who were being held there. Further, Reuters reported that 6,342 migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East were apprehended by Mexican authorities trying to enter that country in the first six months of 2016.The figures were accompanied by a similar growth in migrants from outside the American continent attempting to enter the U.S. along its Southwest border, but the report made no mention of the migrants' religion nor stated that they were all using forged papers: The U.S. agents' findings come as Mexican immigration data show 6,342 Asian, African and Middle Eastern migrants were apprehended trying to enter Mexico in the first six months of this year. That was up from 4,261 in all of 2015, and 1,831 in 2014. U.S. border apprehensions point to the same trend. Between October 2015 and May 2016, U.S. agents apprehended 5,350 African and Asian migrants at the U.S. Southwest border. That's up from 6,126 in all of fiscal year 2015 and 4,172 in all of fiscal year 2014. U.S. concerns about potential security risks from migrants using the unusual and circuitous southern route have been growing in recent years, following a string of Islamic State-inspired attacks in the West and the surge in Syrian refugees fleeing that country's civil war. Five Syrian nationals detained in Honduras last November were part of a wider group of seven Syrians who acquired forged passports in Brazil and then went by land to Argentina on their way north, a U.S. government source familiar with that case said. There was no evidence to suggest the men were militants. While the Reuters report does make it clear that upticks in migrants making arduous treks through Latin America and Mexico in order to enter the United States (sometimes with forged documents) presents a security concern, most of those migrants are persons seeking better economic prospects or fleeing persecution, not 'jihadists' intent on wreaking terror in America. U.S. agents are making efforts to partner with immigration authorities in other countries to gain intelligence on who may be heading north to America's southern border with Mexico. The web sites mentioned above published fear-mongering headlines about 'thousands' of Muslim migrants converging on the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Reuters report specifically identified only about a dozen people hailing from predominantly Muslim countries trying to migrate to the United States through Mexico. None of those persons were tied in the Reuters report with any type of terrorist activity. It's also worth noting that while the union that represents employees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) endorsed Trump, the agency itself has made no political endorsement, as no governmental agency would.","6,000 Muslims with Forged Papers Caught at Southern Border A claim that 6,000 Muslim migrants were captured at the U.S.-Mexico border with forged papers is unsubstantiated.

In both cases, other ways of tabulating employment changes suggest less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines. By using private-sector job figures, for instance, Clinton and Castro overlook total job changes. Right off the bat, that paints Obama's numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of his term. We consulted regional economist Cheryl Abbot of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics who said that if you count from the start of Obama's term in January 2009 through August 2012, private-sector jobs have increased by 415,000, but total jobs decreased by 261,000 due to losses of government jobs. Since this timeframe includes the start of Obama's term -- when the economy was in freefall and before Obama's policies had time to take effect -- we don't think this is the best way to measure it. The way Clinton did it is another way to count it. He started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010. The latest month-to-month dip in private-sector jobs occurred between January and February 2010 when the number of those kinds of jobs dropped by 27,000 to nearly 107 million jobs. Over the 30 months from February 2010 through August 2012, private-sector jobs increased by a little more than 4.6 million, totaling 111.4 million of late. However, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking. If you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by nearly 3.5 million. That's well below Clinton's 4.5 million figure and Castro's 4.6 million figure. Finally, as we've written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama's policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role. Our ruling By most measures, the number of jobs in the United States has increased on Obama's watch, though Castro did some cherry-picking in coming up with the 4.6 million number.

Rather, the San Antonio mayor stumped for President Barack Obama in the battleground state of Virginia and made another national TV appearance. On the Sept. 9, 2012, edition of NBC's 'Meet the Press,' host David Gregory asked Castro if 'Americans blame this president for the job situation or do they listen to President (Bill) Clinton who said nobody could have fixed it faster, not even me? I mean that seems to be -- if Americans believe that, then maybe they give him a chance.' Castro replied: 'I think President Clinton did a stellar job, as usual, making the case that we see now 30 straight months of private sector job growth, 4.6 million jobs created. and I believe that folks see that kind of progress around the country. And so for (Republican presidential nominee) Mitt Romney to say, well, there's been no progress whatsoever, folks can tell the difference between what they see out there, and what he's saying.' Castro was referring to Clnton's convention speech nominating Obama for a second term. In the speech, Clinton repeated a talking point often used by Democrats to tout Obama's record on job creation. 'In the last 29 months,' Clinton said, 'our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.' Afterward, PolitiFact rated Clinton's claim as Mostly True, saying that while Clinton had cherry-picked the job numbers to paint Obama's record in the most favorable light, his wording held up.

The most recent case of a man harassed and arrested by the police for sporting an Anonymous mask happened in the House Gallery, during the Maricopa County hearing over suspected election fraud. This article referred to an to incident that took place on 28 March 2016 at the Arizona House of Representatives. According to a news report from the Arizona Capitol Times, several activists interrupted a House floor session in protest of the long lines at polling places many of them experienced during the Arizona primary election. While it's true that one of those protesters was arrested while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, his disruptive behavior (and not the act of wearing a mask) was the reason for his arrest: The man with the mask refused to leave, and when police put their hands on him he clutched onto his chair. Those around him started screaming that the police were out of line, and later that the police were choking him. Eventually DPS officers were able to pry him loose. Department of Public Safety Captain Damon Cecil said the House's Sergeant of Arms wanted the man in the mask to leave and asked troopers to remove him. Cecil said he was yelling different slogans and was warned but continued to be disruptive. According to Phoenix television station KNXV, the man in the Anonymous mask was identified as 23-year-old Jonathan McRae, who was taken into custody for resisting arrest, aggravated assault against an officer, and criminal trespassing. Court records also stated that he was 'yelling and causing a disturbance in the gallery of the House of Representatives building' but made no mention of McRae's being arrested for wearing an Anonymous mask, or of any law under which such an act would by itself be deemed illegal. Your News Wire based their exaggerated article off of a minor and unrelated detail from one man's arrest. By the same logic, Your News Wire could have published articles claiming that dreadlocks, t-shirts, or noses were now illegal in the United States, since McRae was in possession of all three of those items in addition to the Guy Fawkes mask.",Is Wearing Anonymous Masks in Public Illegal?

'Since the 2008 General Assembly, we have permanently cut biennial funding for public education by $1.6 billion through changes in the Standards of Quality funding formula,' VEA President Kitty Boitnott said in a Jan. 23 news conference. The $1.6 billion cited by Boitnott is an eye-popping number. We wanted to know if her figure is correct and if the loss of the funding is, as she said 'permanent.' The Standards of Quality are minimum mandates Virginia sets forth for public education on teacher-pupil ratios, benefits for educators and basic curricula. The General Assembly sets the benchmarks every two years after considering recommendations by the state Board of Education. Virginia is required by law to pay 55 percent of the overall cost of the SOQs and local school districts must pay the rest. For this two-year budget cycle, which began July 1, 2010, the state will pay about $9.6 billion toward meeting the SOQs, and localities will pay about $7.8 billion. Boitnott is essentially saying the state obligation would have been $1.6 billion higher if the General Assembly had not taken steps since 2008 to lower Virginia's education standards. Robley Jones, the VEA's director of government relations, said Boitnott's figures came from a report on education funding released last month by the Senate Finance Committee. The study contained a table detailing the 10 'substantive' reductions to public education programs approved by the General Assembly since 2008. The cuts came to a biennial total of $1.57 billion, and Boitnott rounded up. The biggest savings came from reducing the number of support positions -- such as clerks, teacher aides and bus drivers -- required by the state. That action removed $754 million in SOQ obligations. Lawmakers in 2010 found another $513 million in savings by eliminating certain types of equipment and travel from SOQ calculations and changing the formula for estimating health care costs for school employees. Boitnott, however, is slightly off in her analysis of the the Senate Finance Committee's data. The table makes no claim that the 10 cut education programs it lists were part of the SOQs, as Boitnott suggests. In fact, four of the items were not part of the state's minimum requirements, according to Charles Pyle, a spokesman for the Department of Education. They account for $174 million in biennial costs. So the real reduction in SOQ mandates comes to about $1.4 billion per biennium. Jones, who provided the information for Boitnott's statement, said he made an inadvertent mistake in computing the SOQ reductions. That brings us down to one last question: Are the cuts to the SOQ formula permanent, as Boitnott says? Technically, they are not. The General Assembly is free to restore the funding, but that is not likely to happen. Julie Grimes, a spokeswoman at the Department of Education, said officials there cannot recall an instance where legislators cut funding for an SOQ program and later replenished it. When the state reduces funding for SOQ programs, localities often absorb the costs. Most school districts in Virginia are not satisfied with just attaining minimum SOQ standards and fund their schools at far greater levels than the state demands. The SOQs allow legislators to claim they fund 55 percent of the state's educational mandates. But a different picture emerges when total expenditures on Virginia public education are computed. The localities pay about 50 percent, the state, the state pays 40 percent and roughly 10 percent comes from the federal government. Our ruling: Boitnott said that since 2008, the legislature has permanently cut $1.6 billion in programs from the state's formula for funding public schools.

He cited credible research that showed the region is among the most at risk of property damage from coastal flooding. He's conflating that research with the effects of sea level rise, but several experts told us the problems are related. It's striking that Tampa Bay is already in great danger when it comes to potential property loss, but Bailey should have been more specific. There are other ways to measure the consequences of rising oceans beyond real estate. When we consider some of these factors, other major cities could be considered worse off than Tampa Bay. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","The head of Tampa Bay's Sierra Club chapter warned the Hillsborough County Commission that building more roads will only make global warming's consequences worse for the entire region. Chapter chairman Kent Bailey told commissioners in a Feb. 22, 2016, letter that the Sierra Club would not be supporting a proposed half-cent transportation sales tax referendum known as Go Hillsborough. Bailey said the measure doesn't set aside enough money to pay for expanding mass transit. He argued that adding more roads and more cars to an already congested system will only make matters worse by increasing carbon pollution. 'Our community is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world,' Bailey wrote. He added that the Tampa Bay area will be among the first to suffer from flooding caused by climate change. There's no doubt the oceans are rising, and Tampa Bay will feel the effects. But is the region among the most endangered in the world? Let's just say that we found the bay area has a lot to lose. Flooding vs. sea level rise There are a bunch of ways to measure how climate change will affect the world's cities. People will be displaced, economies will be ruined, or you may end up with not enough water (or too much). These are all issues Tampa Bay faces, so buckle up. When we asked Bailey how he came up with his ranking, he said he was referring to potential property losses, mostly in terms of real estate. 'We can move our people. But our fixed assets are a different story,' he said. He cited several sources, including a report from global-warming researchers Climate Central, and a Scientific American article that said St. Petersburg was in particular danger from sea level rise. He also pointed to a 2008 paper from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The study focused on the effects of climate extremes on port cities - particularly storm surge. Coastal flooding is different than sea level rise, but experts told us Bailey is using a fair benchmark for comparison. Vulnerability to storm surge and sea level rise often are conflated in discussions on climate change, they said. 'They are related, but not exactly the same,' said Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central. In general, sea level rise can make a big impact on flooding, and will assuredly make storm surges and flooding worse in the future. David Hastings, a marine science professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, said storm surges are especially dangerous in Tampa and St. Petersburg because of the relatively shallow offshore shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher sea levels will make surges even more dangerous. But back to the OECD study: Economists examined 136 port cities and found that Tampa and St. Petersburg together were among the 10 cities with the most property at risk to wind damage and coastal flooding from storm surge. And that's for right now, let alone after sea levels increase. 'The top 10 cities in terms of assets exposed are Miami, Greater New York, New Orleans, Osaka-Kobe, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Nagoya, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach,' the paper read. Those rankings could get better if steps were taken to mitigate flooding, the study said. But they could also get worse, as cities grow and gain more people. The effects of subsidence (the physical earth below the city changing or sinking, which is a major issue in Tampa Bay) and the changing climate could magnify the risk, too. Many of the same economists revisited the rankings in a 2013 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Tampa-St. Petersburg came in as the seventh-most at risk of flooding. If you're looking for a price tag for how much Tampa Bay stands to lose, the OECD has one: In a catastrophic, once-in-100-years flood, losses to the region currently could be $49.6 billion. University of South Florida oceanography professor Gary Mitchum noted real estate losses are only part of the story. As the oceans rise permanently, the region's tourism-based economy will suffer extensively. Many people who can afford to simply move away probably will, but low-wage workers dependent on disappearing service industry jobs will be stuck. Of course, the region's property loss ranking may change some as population, planning and even geography shift. But these are from economists, considering economic impact. If we examined this another way - say, how many people will be permanently displaced by the eventual coastal floods that won't recede - other places will have it much worse than Tampa Bay. Even the OECD researchers said their rankings would be different by that measure. Cities in China and southeast Asian countries, like Bangladesh and Vietnam, will be much more affected that way. It's much harder to quantify how the human toll will affect regions because you can't easily attach a dollar amount to it. 'The social impact of this is much more complicated,' Mitchum said. 'The result that you get depends on how you assess it.'",,,,'Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

The encounter escalated, McClain was put in a chokehold, and a few days later he was dead. The Denver Post reported: Elijah McClain, 23, was walking home from a store around 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening when authorities contacted him near Billings Street and Colfax Avenue in Denver. Someone had called 911 to report a 'suspicious person' who was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms. McClain routinely wore masks when he was outside because he had anemia - a blood condition - and became cold easily, according to his family. [...] After a struggle, McClain was handcuffed and officers requested medical assistance. Aurora Fire Rescue later injected him with ketamine in an attempt to sedate him, police said. He suffered cardiac arrest during the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital. [...] The following Friday McClain was declared 'brain dead' and was expected to be taken off life support that afternoon, family members said. He died later that day. McClain's family called for the police officers involved in his death to be prosecuted, but it was announced in November that they would not face criminal charges. McClain's case did not receive the same national attention as other similar incidents, but it was thrust back into the spotlight after George Floyd's death in May 2020, when protests against racial injustice and police violence spread across the United States. In June 2020, an image of text supposedly relaying McClain's 'last words' started going viral on social media: This message reads: I can't breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That's my house. I was just going home. I'm an introvert. I'm just different. That's all. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don't even kill flies! I don't eat meat! But I don't judge people, I don't judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I'll do it. You all are phenomenal. You are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I'm a mood Gemini. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ow, that really hurt. You are all very strong. Teamwork makes the dream work. Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't trying to do that. I just can't breathe correctly. This is a largely accurate transcript of what McClain said in a video recording of his encounter with police in August 2019. These remarks can be heard on the body cam footage of one of the police officers involved in the incident. An official copy of this video from the Aurora Police Department can be seen below (the relevant portion of the video starts at around the 12:30 mark). The text in the viral transcript has been slightly edited to remove repeated phrases and inaudible moments (McClain says 'I'm just different' multiple times), but none of the edits are misleading. The text describing actions in the viral post - at one point noting that McClain was crying, at another noting that he vomited - are also accurate. This viral transcript does omit at least one phrase uttered by McClain during this encounter. A few moments after the final words of this viral transcript, McClain says 'I can't fix myself' before vomiting again. NPR reported: Someone picks up a body camera and McClain can be seen lying on his side with both hands restrained behind his back, and one officer jamming his knee on the man's torso. When McClain attempts to roll over to vomit, they shout at him to 'stop fighting us.' 'If you keep messing around, I'm going to bring my dog out here and he's going to bite you,' says an officer standing over McClain. McClain proceeds to vomit. 'I can't fix myself,' he says weakly. McClain's body goes limp and he passes out. Eventually one officer asks, 'Are you OK?' But he's not asking McClain. He's speaking to the officer on top of him. 'Yeah, I'm good,' the officer says shifting his weight. When paramedics arrived, McClain was injected with ketamine (described by Aurora Police as 'a standard medication routinely utilized to reduce agitation') and then loaded into an ambulance where he suffered cardiac arrest. On August 30, McClain was pronounced brain dead, removed from life support, and died. In February 2021, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found that police officers did not have legal basis to stop McClain. The Denver Post reports: Aurora police officers did not have a legal basis to force Elijah McClain to stop walking, to frisk him or to use a chokehold on him, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found. The initial investigation into the incident led by the department's detectives in the Major Crimes Unit was also deeply flawed, the investigators found. The detectives failed to ask basic, critical questions of the officers involved in McClain's death and instead 'the questions frequently appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating 'magic language' found in court rulings,' the report states. [...] Aurora city officials on Monday morning released the 157-page report on the death of McClain at the hands of city police and paramedics. The city hired a panel of investigators to examine the officers' and paramedics' decision and make policy recommendations 'to lessen the chance of another tragedy like this one from happening again,' the report states.Recent Updates Updated [22 February 2021]: Included additional reporting from the Denver Post.

But that's not the same as 'repudiating' or admonishing Lewis for making that comparison. Because Obama's campaign never specifically criticized Lewis, we rate McCain's statement as True.","In the third, final and most combative debate, Sen. John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of failing to repudiate nasty statements against McCain involving racial politics. 'Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful,' McCain said during the Hofstra University debate on Oct. 15, 2008. 'And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.' McCain referred to comments by Rep. Lewis, D-Georgia, who is an icon in the civil rights movement. In a statement Oct. 11, 2008, Lewis related the tenor of McCain campaign events to political tactics by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace that encouraged attacks over people seeking civil rights protections in the 1960s. 'What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history,' Lewis wrote. 'Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division, and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse.' Lewis issued his statement after news reports catalogued a series of McCain campaign events in which some audience members shouted such things as 'terrorist' and 'kill him' when Obama's name was mentioned by the speakers. The remarks came as the McCain campaign embarked on a decidedly aggressive approach, focusing on Obama's long-ago association with 1960s radical William Ayers. But the question is whether Obama was silent when Lewis likened the tone of the McCain rallies to those of Wallace and the segregationists. Obama's campaign did break with Lewis' statement the same day he made it, although it also said Lewis 'was right to condemn' statements by Palin associating Obama with terrorists. Here's the statement Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton issued on Oct. 11: 'Senator Obama does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies. But John Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night, as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for President of the United States 'pals around with terrorists.' 'As Barack Obama has said himself, the last thing we need from either party is the kind of angry, divisive rhetoric that tears us apart at a time of crisis when we desperately need to come together. That is the kind of campaign Senator Obama will continue to run in the weeks ahead.' But that statement never explicitly said Lewis was wrong - which is crucial to repudiating someone or something. Instead, Obama's campaign said Lewis' comparison wasn't correct. In the debate, Obama did say Lewis 'inappropriately drew a comparison' between the civil rights trouble and McCain rallies. Lewis later said he could have phrased his words differently, because he didn't want to relate McCain and Palin directly to Wallace's tactics. But he said he accomplished his goal of highlighting the dangerous tone of the rallies. Obama's campaign did promptly issue a statement, disputing the comparison that Lewis made.

Escher, famous for his 'impossible reality' artworks, such as the never-ending Penrose Stairway) which 'violates the laws of physics and basic logic by looping back into itself': As described in a 30 April 2013 article published on RIT's web site, the video showing off the unusual stairway was supposedly the third installment of a 'Can You Imagine' series about 'interesting facts, stories and myths of RIT': Is it possible for a staircase to violate the laws of physics and basic logic by looping back into itself? This is one of the questions Michael Lacanilao, a film and animation graduate student at RIT, examines in his video series and Imagine RIT exhibit The Escherian Stairwell.Lacanilao created the video series, 'Can You Imagine,' to highlight the many interesting facts, stories and myths of RIT. The exhibit, located in Artistic Alley in Gannett Hall room A171, will help festivalgoers search for the stairwell and give them a behind the scenes look at 'Can You Imagine.' 'Four years can go by quickly and a lot of us don't have the time to learn about all the things that RIT does and offers,' says Lacanilao. 'When we take the time to venture outside our daily routines, we find that it really is the place where the left brain and right brain collide. I'm proud to be a part of that.' Quite obviously no physics-defying 'Escherian Stairwell' exists in the real world. The video was a bit of trickery created through the use of deceptive camera angles, careful editing, and digital effects, produced in conjunction with a (failed) Kickstarter campaign ('The Stairwell Project: Building a Modern Myth') intended to help fund the creation of videos, articles, web pages, and other material establishing a backstory for the mythical stairway in time for Imagine RIT, the school's annual Innovation & Creativity Festival: The most powerful aspects of myths are their ability to incite wonder and excitement. We're creating a myth that does these things while also challenging audiences to think.The myth is that located in Rochester, NY, is the Escherian Stairwell, an architectural marvel that seems to violate the laws of physics and basic logic by looping back into itself. In order to lend credence to this myth, we're creating an episode for a family-friendly science show that demonstrates the staircase in action, various clips from a 1997 documentary with prominent thinkers grappling with the existence of this apparent contradiction and pontificating on its implications, and a whole slew of supplemental online materials for today's internet savvy audience to stumble across while trying to see if this thing is real (websites, scholarly articles, fan-pages, blogs, etc.). Help us build the myth! We are passionate about immersing audiences with a sense of wonder and surrounding them with a wealth of detail executed with such rigorous realism that they can choose to step into it, get lost in it, and believe in it. Films like Close Encounters and 2001 inspired us with awe, and even a hint of fear, when we first saw them. How do we capture that feeling again? The internet and the age of social media seem to be opening up doors to reinvent the medium and reignite those in-theater experiences that have gotten stale over the decades. The following video features an explanation of the intent behind the Kickstarter campaign:",Is This 'Escherian Stairwell' Real?

She claimed that a 'peer reviewed, scientific study showed that the COVID-19 vaccine causes two deaths for every three lives it saves.' A sign posted near Wheeler as she spoke repeated the claim more bluntly: 'COVID vax kills two people for every three saved.' A Facebook post for her show's episode was headlined: 'The Vaccine Study You're Not Allowed To See.' Calling the study 'a big deal,' Wheeler said 'this will be a test for Big Tech to see if they actually want people to know the truth, or if they're censoring true information.' But the information was not accurate. The video was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) What Wheeler didn't report was that two days before her video was posted on Facebook, the journal that published the study posted a notice raising serious questions about it. The study, 'The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations - We Should Rethink the Policy,' was done by three European researchers, led by Harald Walach, professor at Poznan University of Medical Sciences in Poland. The researchers said that they calculated from a large Israeli field study the number of people who needed to be vaccinated to prevent one death; and that they used the Adverse Drug Reactions database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register to get the number of vaccination cases 'reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects.' The researchers concluded: 'For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination.' The European Medicines Agency, however, warns that its data on adverse reactions can't be used on its own to conclude whether a vaccine caused death: 'The information on this website relates to suspected side effects, i.e. medical events that have been observed following the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines, but which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine. These events may have been caused by another illness or be associated with another medicine taken by the patient at the same time.' The study was published in the journal Vaccines on June 24. Four days later, the journal appended a note to the study, expressing concerns about the study and calling its main conclusion incorrect. The note said: 'The journal is issuing this expression of concern to alert readers to significant concerns regarding the paper cited above. Serious concerns have been raised about misinterpretation of the data and the conclusions. 'The major concern is the misrepresentation of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts and misrepresentation of the data, e.g., Abstract: 'For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination.' 'Stating that these deaths linked to vaccination efforts is incorrect and distorted.' A board member of the journal, University of Oxford immunologist Katie Ewer, tweeted that she resigned the board post because of the publication. She said the study 'is grossly negligent and I can't believe it passed peer-review. I hope it will be retracted.' The journal's associate editor, Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, also tweeted that he resigned because of the study. Walach, an author of the study, told Retraction Watch, a website that reported on the aftermath of the study, that he does not agree with the expression of concern, saying 'we have used and analyzed the data correctly, and not incorrectly. But that the data are less than optimal is clear to everyone and we said so in our paper. The purpose is to generate enough momentum for governments and researchers to finally create the good data that are long overdue.' Wheeler didn't reply to a request seeking comment.

Nelson wasn't using that as part of his defense, but as an example of a capricious or fanciful doubt. Nelson was arguing that the points made in his defense were not capricious or fanciful. The jury did not agree with his points and convicted Chauvin on all counts of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Still, he wasn't actually suggesting space aliens were to blame. We rate this post False.","The trial of Derek Chauvin ended with guilty charges for the killing of George Floyd, but there's some confusion as to what Chauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, was trying to prove in a comment he made during his closing argument. The sentence was captured in a now-viral TikTok video: 'Space aliens flew in, inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin, and caused this death.' Additional text on the video reads, 'If I ever go to jail make this guy my lawyer.' The video got 1.2 million views, and a lot of comments from people who were confused by Nelson's statement. Context is definitely needed. We took a look at the complete transcript of Nelson's closing argument. Here's the surrounding sentences of what he said: 'Essentially, what the state has to convince you is that the evidence in this case completely eliminates any reasonable doubt. Or in other words, leaving only unreasonable doubt. Capricious, fanciful, capricious doubt. Capricious means unpredictable. Fanciful, space aliens flew in, inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin and caused this death. That's fanciful. Beyond the reasonable doubt, it is the highest standard in the law. It doesn't mean beyond all possibility of doubt, because I suppose space aliens may have been inhabiting his body, but that's obviously fanciful and capricious.' Ric Simmons, professor of law at the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University, broke it down for us - Nelson was not using space aliens as an argument for the defense, but rather as an analogy of what an unreasonable doubt would be. 'Lawyers in criminal cases do this all the time. Nelson was trying to distinguish reasonable doubt from other kinds of doubt,' Simmons said. 'As he said, 'capricious and fanciful doubt' includes every kind of uncertainty, including the absurd and highly improbable scenarios like space aliens.' Simmons said that Nelson had tried to prove the points made in his defense were reasonable, which were that Floyd died because of drugs, an enlarged heart, or carbon monoxide from the squad car exhaust. Steve Schleicher, one of the attorneys for the prosecution, used his closing argument to say that there had been no medical evidence of any of the above, and that Floyd died because of the excessive force that Chauvin and the other officers used when they put him into the 'prone' position. 'It's a position you use to secure someone in handcuffs,' Schleicher explained. 'And then when you're done with that, you immediately roll them on their side, right? That's the position he was in. Proning him was completely unnecessary, and this is where the excessive force begins, right?' Schleicher later added, 'Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw.' Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated for 10 hours, and came back to the courtroom with convictions on all three charges against Chauvin of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. His sentencing is expected in two months.",,,,Derek Chauvin's attorney said that space aliens 'inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin and caused this death.,refuted,false,"<p>Capricious doubt or not, Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts of killing George Floyd.</p>",politifact

In the most favorable light, that's a total of roughly 50,000 job-years spread out over five years, with 1,100 of those jobs continuing in perpetuity. But 40,500 of those jobs -- more than 80 percent -- are confined to just two years during the rail construction, 2012 and 2013. Scott said the high-speed rail project provides 'short-term jobs.' He's largely right. More than 80 percent of the jobs created (talking job-years again) only exist for two years, and 98 percent of the jobs last no more than four years while the rail's being built. That leaves just 1,100 direct and indirect jobs created as a result of the operation of the train that are truly permanent. We rate Scott's claim Mostly True.","Florida Gov. Rick Scott made time during his two-day promotional tour of northern U.S. cities on March 2, 2011, to stop into New York's Fox News studios and talk high-speed rail. In an interview with Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Scott first brushed off a lawsuit filed by two state senators challenging the new governor's ability to unilaterally kill the project. 'I represent the taxpayers,' he said. 'This doesn't make any sense.' Doocy then asked if a high-speed train is 'really what people need.' But before Scott could answer, Doocy said the project would provide jobs, right? 'Short-term jobs,' Scott said. 'The federal government gives you all this money and then you have to pay for it down the road.' In a previous item, we checked a claim from U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, that the rail line from Tampa to Orlando would create 60,000 jobs and rated that False. This time, we wanted to drill down on Scott's assertion that the jobs created would be 'short-term jobs.' For starters, we should note that estimating job numbers is a little bit like estimating ridership figures when it comes to the Tampa-Orlando train. There is science to it, of course, but there is a bit of art, too. Nevertheless, the Florida Department of Transportation provided a detailed job-creation estimate (page 16) as part of its application to the federal government for high-speed rail funding in October 2009. The state was awarded $2.4 billion in federal money for the $2.7 billion project, the money that Scott rejected. The job estimates are spread out over the four-county area along the 84-mile high-speed line, covering Hillsborough, Polk, Orange and Osceola counties. The 2009 application was based on a four-year construction period, beginning in 2011, and broke down the jobs created into three basic categories -- construction, engineering services and operations/maintenance. The estimate includes direct jobs -- those directly hired as a result of the project -- and indirect jobs, which FDOT said are jobs created to support the suppliers of the materials and equipment to the project. FDOT concluded that the rail line would create a total of 48,800 direct and indirect jobs over the construction of the system and another 1,100 total jobs once the line is in operation. (FDOT predicted the line would start running in 2015.) The jobs are measured in job-years, which is different than how most people would classify a job. The idea is that a 'job' equals a year someone is employed -- that's a job-year. It could be one person working a year, or two people working six months each, or some other combination. In counting job-years, FDOT adds each year's job total to create one big number. It's a perfectly valid calculation -- as long as you understand the difference -- but to many, it comes off as a way to inflate the impact of a project. Here's how the FDOT breaks down the job creation in job-years: Employment (job-years) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Construction Direct 2,100 9,700 9,000 1,000 0 Total 4,500 20,400 18,900 2,100 0 Engineering Services Direct 700 500 0 0 0 Total 1,700 1,200 0 0 0 Operations/Maintenance Direct 0 0 0 0 600 Total 0 0 0 0 1,100 Total Direct 2,800 10,200 9,000 1,000 600 Total Overall 6,200 21,600 18,900 2,100 1,100 After 2015, FDOT says, the operations and maintenance jobs would continue (600 direct, 1,100 total) while the construction-related work would not.

The post also posed a hypothetical question to viewers, asking them if they would be able to leave their child 'hungry and without a roof' over their head in the same situation: This woman abandoned her son on the street because her partner asked her. Would you be able to leave your son hungry and without a roof to sleep? This video (which can be viewed in full at the bottom of this article) racked up more than 250,000 shares and 22 million views within a day of its initial posting. And although the footage is genuine, its accompanying backstory is not. This video was taken in the Zhudong Township of Taiwan and originally went viral in early April 2018. However, the woman in the video did not abandon her son to starve and sleep on the street due to her partner's request; she quarreled with her child after he refused to leave a park. A contemporaneous article published by Chinese-language news outlet United Daily News reported that the woman, identified only by the surname Xiao Xing, was trying to get her three children to leave a park after it started to rain. According to the story, she only 'pretended' to drive away and the incident was reported to child services, but it is unclear if the investigation found the parent to be guilty of negligence or abuse. What is clear, however, is that this child was not left to starve on the street. Police reported that the boy was not physically harmed during the incident and that he was eventually brought home from the park.","Did a Woman Abandon Her Son on the Street to Appease Her Partner?

The letter said a majority of Americans now support it. Indeed, public opinion on gay marriage is shifting quickly. How quickly? Let's just say we're glad we waited a day to publish our item. The letter came on the heels of the White House announcement that it would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. The act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. The letter, sponsored by Freedom to Marry, a group that advocates for marriage for same-sex couples, called the DOMA decision 'a powerful statement about the law' and an 'important step toward equal protection under the law for all Americans.' The letter urged the president 'to complete your journey and join us, and the majority of Americans, who support the freedom to marry.' It was signed by a group of actors, musicians, business executives and pro athletes including entertainers Ellen DeGeneres and Martin Sheen; musicians Rufus Wainwright and Melissa Etheridge; and football players Scott Fujita and Brendon Ayanbadejo. Obama's position to date has been support for 'strong civil unions,' but he allowed in December that, 'my feelings are constantly evolving,' and that he will 'continue to wrestle' with the issue. The American public has long been deeply divided over the question of same-sex marriage, and so we wondered if the letter is accurate that a majority of Americans now support it. Jackie Yodashkin, a spokeswoman for Freedom to Marry, backed up the claim by pointing us toward two polls. The first was a poll conducted by the Associated Press in August 2010 that asked the question, 'Should the Federal Government give legal recognition to marriages between couples of the same sex, or not?' It was supported by 52 percent and opposed by 46 percent. The percentages were nearly the reverse in a poll the year before. The second was a CNN poll, also in August 2010, in which 52 percent responded 'yes' to the question, 'Do you think gays and lesbians should have a constitutional right to get married and have their marriage recognized by law as valid?' But the results differed slightly depending how the question was asked. Half got a question that read 'should have' right to marry and the other half was asked if gay people 'have' a right to marry. The 'should' version produced a 52-46 majority in favor of gay marriage, while the 'have a right' question produced a 49-51 majority against. Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and professor of political science at University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the results show people understand 'it isn't a settled constitutional right, though a majority think it should be one.' Other polls show growing support for gay marriage, but less than a majority. For example, a Pew Research Center poll released on March 3, 2011, found that while the clear trend is heading in favor of gay marriage, the American public remains about equally divided. According to a Pew news release on its study, 'The new poll finds that about as many adults now favor (45 percent) as oppose (46 percent) allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Last year opponents outnumbered supporters 48 percent to 42 percent. Opposition to same-sex marriage has declined by 19 percentage points since 1996, when 65 percent opposed gay marriage and only 27 percent were in favor.' A review of the totality of recent polls suggests that, 'opinion has moved, but it is not a majority sentiment yet,' said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'I'd rate it 'not true yet,'' Franklin said. 'There are some individual polls that have shown support larger than opposition but the overall trend isn't quite there yet.' But it's likely to be true soon, he said. 'The consistency of the trends since 2005 all but guarantee support will exceed opposition within the year,' said Franklin, who wrote about the trend in a recent Huffington Post story. Then, on March 18, 2011, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a slim majority now supports gay marriage. According to the Post story about it, 'The results underscore the nation's increasingly tolerant views about homosexuals, and parallel a string of recent legal and legislative victories for gay rights advocates.' 'Five years ago, at 36 percent, support for gay marriage barely topped a third of all Americans,' the story states. 'Now, 53 percent say gay marriage should be legal, marking the first time in Post-ABC polling that a majority has said so.' The story notes that opponents of same-sex marriage took issue with the wording in the poll: 'Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?' According to the story, 'Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, argued that the term 'illegal' could be inferred to mean that violators could be imprisoned, which most Americans would consider harsh.' It is the same language used in Post-ABC News polls since 2003. 'The only poll that counts is a free and fair vote on the part of the people,' Brown told the Washington Post. 'We've seen these biased polls time and time again -- right before votes in which same-sex marriage is rejected. It's absurd. The people of this country have not changed their opinion about marriage.' A couple of other caveats. When the option of civil unions (short of marriage) is added to the mix, the numbers change. In several recent polls that asked which of three options best describes their preference -- legalizing same-sex marriage, civil unions or none -- the top-rated option was legalizing marriage, with about 37 to 40 percent support. 'I would not rate that as evidence of majority support for gay marriage, though it is an interesting change from the early 2000s when no legal recognition was the largest category,' Franklin said. One other factor to consider: Public opinion sometimes shifts when the issue of gay marriage really heats up. 'We saw movement away from gay marriage in 2004-05, showing that despite the long-term trend there is a possibility of reaction against expansion of gay marriage when the issue is made especially salient,' Franklin said. 'But that said, it is hard to imagine the lines don't cross in the next 12 months or so, given how much the gap closed in each of the last five years.' Bottom line, most of the polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that while there is a clear trend in recent years toward support for gay marriage, but it is not quite yet a majority. But there are some polls that have found the tipping point has been reached, and that a slim majority now support gay marriage. And that includes the newest poll, from the Washington Post-ABC News. And so we rate the claim Mostly True.

'I would not rate that as evidence of majority support for gay marriage, though it is an interesting change from the early 2000s when no legal recognition was the largest category,' Franklin said. One other factor to consider: Public opinion sometimes shifts when the issue of gay marriage really heats up. 'We saw movement away from gay marriage in 2004-05, showing that despite the long-term trend there is a possibility of reaction against expansion of gay marriage when the issue is made especially salient,' Franklin said. 'But that said, it is hard to imagine the lines don't cross in the next 12 months or so, given how much the gap closed in each of the last five years.' Bottom line, most of the polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that while there is a clear trend in recent years toward support for gay marriage, but it is not quite yet a majority. But there are some polls that have found the tipping point has been reached, and that a slim majority now support gay marriage. And that includes the newest poll, from the Washington Post-ABC News.

In his capacity as the state's attorney general, Abbott said in an Oct. 15, 2014, letter to David Feldman, Houston's city attorney, that Feldman's 'office has demanded several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons.' Abbott, who posted his letter on his office's website, was speaking to the city's legal defense efforts against a lawsuit brought by local voters striving to repeal a city ordinance. Houston's City Council, led by Mayor Annise Parker, approved the Houston Equal RIghts Ordinance (HERO) in 2014 in a move described by proponents as protecting the rights of transgendered people by permitting Houstonians to use bathrooms in businesses and public facilities of the gender with which they personally identify. Sermons were reportedly sought after a push to put a repeal proposal before voters in November 2014 didn't succeed. On Aug. 4, 2014, according to a Houston Chronicle news story, Parker and Feldman announced that over half of 50,000 signatures on a petition to put HERO's repeal on the ballot were invalid. According to the Chronicle, Houston attorneys threw out more than 2,000 pages with about 11,300 signatures because the people who collected the signatures were either not registered voters in Houston or did not sign the petition themselves. In reaction the next day, several residents filed a lawsuit charging the city with wrongfully invalidating the repeal petition. The city issued the subpoenas, as allowed by Texas law, as part of its defense in the lawsuit, in which it had said it will argue against the validity of many signatures on the repeal petition. Feldman told the Chronicle the city included its request for sermons in the subpoenas because pastors who led the petition effort gave instructions on gathering signatures during church service. We sought elaboration from the city -- does Houston's government suspect preachers of coaxing congregants to fake signatures? -- without success. The city also didn't respond to our inquiries about the described subpoenas, copies of which came from Abbott's state office. Legal Documents To our inquiry, Abbott's state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, emailed copies of five subpoenas, issued Sept. 10, 2014 via a city attorney, Kristen Schlemmer, addressed to Houston pastors Steve Riggle, Hernan Castano, Khan Huynh and Dave Welch and church leader Magda Hermida. Each subpoena lists 17 categories of documents and communications which the church leaders were told they had to submit by Oct. 10, 2014, including: --'All speeches, presentations or sermons related to HERO, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by or approved by you or in your possession.' --'All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the petition.' According to the subpoena, documents and communications include writings, notes, diaries, electronic or videotape recordings, emails, instant messages, text messages, emails or relevant 'electronically-stored matter.' Meanwhile, two days after Abbott wrote his letter, the city revised the subpoenas to remove mention of 'sermons.' Parker said opponents deliberately misinterpreted the subpoenas' original language, which sought speech about the signature-gathering process; then again, she also maintained the changes didn't preclude sermons from being produced, according to a Chronicle news story.

Bill Nelson and Republican opponent Gov. Rick Scott when it comes to their record on offshore oil drilling. The ad accuses the term-limited governor of supporting offshore drilling even after the BP oil spill and claims that Scott's January meeting about drilling with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was nothing more than a 'political stunt.' Then the ad by Nelson shifts to his record. 'Bill Nelson actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida's coast,' the text on the screen says. We've already taken a close look at Scott's record on oil drilling when we gave him Full Flop in January. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. But that changed around the time of the meeting with Zinke. This time, we wanted to hone in on Nelson's legislative record. Did Nelson actually write the law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida's coast? Environmental experts said Nelson deserves credit for protecting Florida's Gulf Coast, but the legislation that actually was signed into law didn't have Nelson's name on it. Still, based on news reporting at that time, it was clear that Nelson's bill (and the Republican who co-sponsored it) was the inspiration for the law that enacted a moratorium on drilling on the Gulf Coast. The evidence In 2006, Nelson teamed up with former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez to cosponsor a piece of legislation known as the Permanent Protection for Florida Act of 2006 (S.2239). That bill aimed to prohibit offshore drilling on the outer Continental Shelf near Florida. Specifically, the bill put a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral off much of the coast of Florida until June 30, 2020. Frank Jackalone, the director of Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, praised Nelson and Martinez when the bill was introduced. (The Sierra Club endorsed Nelson). 'Last week our Florida senators introduced legislation that would head off these threats by providing permanent protection for Florida's coasts and extended protection for the remaining moratoria areas,' Jackalone said in a speech he gave at the time '... He and Senator Nelson have given us a wonderful example of bipartisan leadership that puts Florida's economy and environment first.' That bill was introduced in the Senate but did not get a hearing and never made it to law. So can Nelson really take credit for signing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida's coast? Although Nelson and Martinez's legislation was not signed into law, similar ideas were included in a section of another bill known as the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (S.3711), which was sponsored by former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That bill enacted a moratorium on drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle until June 2022, among other things. It was signed into law Dec. 20, 2006. The bill didn't have Nelson's name on it, but each bill aimed to protect Florida's Gulf Coast for oil drilling by placing a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral. Alyson Flournoy, a law professor at the University of Florida, said that if the language of Nelson's bill was included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, we would treat Nelson as the author of that part of the law. Taking a closer look at the text We compared the text of Nelson and Martinez's bill with the text from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to get a better look at the similarities between the two measures. The language in the 2006 Energy Act is not a carbon copy of Nelson's bill, but conveys very similar ideas, especially about where drilling would be prohibited. For example, Nelson and Martinez's bill defined the area off limits as the Florida exclusion zone. That area included: 25 miles west of the Military Mission Line, 150 miles off the Florida Panhandle, including the area commonly known as the 'Stovepipe'' in the Gulf of Mexico, and 150 miles off the Florida east coast. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 enacted the moratorium on any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; any area in the Eastern Planning Area that is within 125 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida and part of the Central Planning Area that is in middle of the Gulf of Mexico. So, Nelson's bill isn't the exact same language, but newspaper outlets at the time said that Nelson and Martinez worked together to make sure the Gulf of Mexico was protected from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. 'Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Mel Martinez, had helped craft the bill, and both voted for it this morning,' the St. Petersburg Times wrote in 2006. 'Martinez, who negotiated the measure with input from Nelson, rebuffed suggestions that the delegation could successfully maintain its 'no drilling' stance,' the Miami Herald wrote after the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act passed the House. Days before the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 was signed in to law. Martinez attended a press conference to speak about it. 'Nelson and I, both from Florida, have had longstanding concerns about protections we felt were necessary for Florida's fragile environment and also because of our very strong economies derived from tourism, that our coastal waters and beaches be protected,' Martinez said. 'For that reason, the features of this bill that are attractive to us is the zone of protection that it creates for Florida along the Gulf Coast while at the same time permitting this very important additional exploration to take place.' Environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida's Gulf coast. 'Nelson out of anybody has the right to brag about being the gatekeeper on the Eastern Gulf,' said Julie Wraithmell, the executive director of Audubon Florida.

Congressional Democrats passed and supported bills that set out to protect people from evictions, including through an eviction moratorium and rental assistance. We rate Trump's claim False.","President Donald Trump criticized Democrats at a press briefing at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he signed four executive actions on evictions, payroll taxes, unemployment benefits and student loans. Trump's executive order on evictions tells federal agencies to consider ways to try to assist renters and homeowners faced with the threat of eviction amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 'The Democrats don't want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction,' Trump said at the briefing. He doubled down on that claim at an Aug. 11 press conference, but it's false. Congressional Democrats have proposed and supported legislation to temporarily ban evictions and help residents pay rent. The CARES Act, a bipartisan coronavirus relief law passed in March, banned evictions for certain renters, including those in federal housing assistance programs. In May, the House passed the HEROES Act, a $3.4 trillion coronavirus relief package introduced by Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, which would extend the ban on evictions for renters and provide people with rent assistance. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews told PolitiFact in an email that the bill was 'unserious,' in part because it includes a portion that would provide cannabis businesses with banking access. 'If Democrats were serious about providing relief for the American people, then they shouldn't have rejected the multiple clean bills put forward by Republicans,' Matthews said. Meanwhile, Democrats are critical of the HEALS Act, a $1.1 trillion Republican-backed coronavirus relief package that doesn't include an eviction moratorium. CARES Act In addition to protecting renters in federal housing assistance programs from evictions, the over $2 trillion CARES Act also protects those in properties with federally backed mortgages. The economic stimulus law was introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., in January and passed in the House and Senate with widespread bipartisan support. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that the CARES Act's eviction provisions covered between 28% and 46% of rental units in the country. That's up to 20 million units, but the law's four-month eviction ban expired in late July, and Trump's executive order did not extend it. HEROES Act Over 200 congressional Democrats voted to support the HEROES Act, which would extend the eviction moratorium for up to a year and expand it to protect homeowners. The bill would also allocate $100 billion to provide residents with emergency rental assistance. 'Being able to give money to people to pay their rent then also helps landlords be able to afford the mortgage on the property, the utilities, taxes, all of the things that it takes to maintain a property,' said Peggy Bailey, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.

5786,3005,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/franklin-graham-equality-act/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In February 2021, as the U.S. House of Representatives voted on the proposed Equality Act, a piece of legislation that would formally and explicitly prohibit various forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of an open letter attributed to the influential evangelist Franklin Graham. The letter typically began 'I am writing to you about a very dangerous piece of legislation-the Equality Act' and was shared widely on Facebook, and republished on various blogs and websites in the final week of February 2021. It contained several assertions about the effect the bill would have in supposedly coercing faith-based organizations to go against their religious convictions by accommodating LGBTQ persons in their hiring practices and in allegedly removing conscientious-abstention allowances for healthcare workers. Graham did indeed author the letter, and it was originally published on the website of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association on Feb. 25. It can be read in full here. The Equality Act can be read here. The House passed it on Feb. 25, and it was introduced in the Senate on March 1. The following fact check offers a breakdown of the accuracy of the claims made by Graham in the letter. Background The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in various aspects of American social, commercial and civic life including voting, public accommodations, education, employment and so on, on various grounds including race, national origin, religion and sex. Over the ensuing decades, a political and legal dispute has arisen over the meaning of sex discrimination, and whether it should be interpreted as covering discrimination linked to sexual orientation and gender identity. Two main methods exist for formalizing and clarifying the extent and meaning of parts of a law: court precedents and additional legislation. A federal court ruling that said sex discrimination in the Civil Rights Act did comprehensively cover discrimination relating to sexual orientation and gender identity would go a long way towards offering LGBTQ people various legal protections in the realms of employment, healthcare, education, and so on. Equally, a new piece of legislation could simply amend the Civil Rights Act itself in order to explicitly specify that sex-based discrimination includes discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity. In the summer of 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling in Bostock vs. Clayton County, a case that addressed workplace discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity. We have written about that case in greater depth previously, but the key implication from the 6-3 vote was summarized by Justice Neil Gorsuch in the majority opinion: Today, we must decide whether an employer can fire someone simply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer is clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. Likely, they weren't thinking about many of the Act's consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis of motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male employees. But the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. Although the court's June 2020 ruling related specifically to Title VII - the section of the Civil Rights Act that deals with employment discrimination - the landmark decision was likely to have far-reaching implications and effectively ban several forms of discrimination against LGBTQ people in various other contexts, such as housing, healthcare and education. In the majority opinion, Gorsuch even made the much broader pronouncement that, 'It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.' With that precedent established, LGBTQ individuals who could demonstrate that they had been fired, looked over for promotion, denied access to housing, healthcare or education, and so on, on the basis of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity, would likely find success in bringing litigation, based on the assumption that courts would be bound by the precedent set in the Supreme Court's June 2020 ruling. However, a more certain, and in some ways more straightforward, way to ensure those legal protections would be to change the text of the law itself, by passing new legislation. This is where the proposed Equality Act comes into play. What the Equality Act Says The preamble to the legislation explicitly mentions that June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, explaining that, on the basis of that precedent, the Equality Act would 'make explicit' the illegality of sex discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity: (13) Numerous provisions of Federal law expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and Federal courts and agencies have correctly interpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, the Supreme Court of the United States correctly held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) that the prohibition on employment discrimination because of sex under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 inherently includes discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status. (14) This Act makes explicit that existing Federal statutes prohibiting sex discrimination in employment (including in access to benefits), healthcare, housing, education, credit, and jury service also prohibit sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. The bill was introduced in the U.S. House by David Cicilline, a Democratic Congressman from Rhode Island, on Feb. 18, 2021. On Feb. 25, it passed the House by a vote of 224-206, and n March 1 it was introduced in the U.S. Senate. Cicilline had introduced a similar bill in 2019, which also passed the House, but never came to a Senate vote. He introduced similar bills in 2015 and 2017, but they never reached a vote in what was a Republican-controlled House on both occasions. The three most significant changes that the Equality Act would bring about, if implemented, are as follows: Change the language in several pieces of federal law so that 'sex discrimination' is explicitly defined as 'including sexual orientation and gender identity' This means, for example, that Chapter 21, Subchapter II of Title 42 of the U.S. criminal code - the federal law that prevents hotels, restaurants, movie theaters and so on from refusing admission or service on the basis of race, religion, or national origin - would also ban discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation or gender identity The change would also mean that the provisions and protections of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, a major piece of federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in federally-funded education, would also extended to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Remove a significant religious freedom defense against discrimination claims The Equality Act explicitly states that it would remove the Religious Freedom Restoration Act - a 1993 law passed with bipartisan support, which provides religious exemptions from various other federal laws - as a basis for challenging various parts (or 'titles') of non-discrimination law, or as the basis for a legal defense against the enforcement of those non-discrimination laws. Expand the list of places that federal law will categorize as 'public accommodations' to include, most notably, any 'establishment that provides health care,' public transport of various kinds, virtual spaces such as online retailers, as well as shelters and food banks, among others. What Franklin Graham Wrote About the Equality Act Broadly, Graham made five main assertions about the likely or inevitable consequences of the Equality Act. The following is our assessment of the accuracy of those claims, which contained a mixture of accurate and inaccurate statements. 1. 'The Equality Act designates schools, churches, and healthcare organizations as 'public accommodations.' With this, schools, churches, and hospitals could be forced to accept the government's beliefs and mandates about sexual orientation and gender identity ...' MOSTLY TRUE: Schools, healthcare providers, and potentially in some circumstances churches, would be prohibited from discriminating against clients, customers, and members of the public on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, but the law would govern only their behavior, not their personal beliefs and attitudes. The Equality Act explicitly designates any 'establishment that provides health care' as a 'public accommodation,' so Graham is right on that count. It doesn't do likewise for schools, but that's a moot point since, as we've discussed, a large swathe of federal law, including Title IX, is given over to non-discrimination in public education. On the question of churches, a spokesperson for Graham clarified for Snopes that: 'The concern with that language is it could easily be used to apply to church facilities under a number of public accommodation headings. Churches that hold weddings or have banquet halls could be required by sexual orientation and gender identity ('SOGI') laws to provide same-sex wedding services in their sanctuary or building.' While the Equality Act does not list churches among public accommodations, it does stipulate that an establishment subject to the non-discrimination laws in question is any individual or entity 'whose operations affect commerce and who is a provider of a good, service, or program.' This would clearly appear to apply to churches that lease or make available buildings for events and functions. On Graham's claim that the legislation means churches could be 'forced to accept the government's beliefs and mandates,' it's important to note that while non-discrimination laws might form part of a broader movement to change the attitudes that prevail within society, the laws themselves do not compel individuals to change their beliefs, but rather their behavior. A restaurant owner might personally hold intensely bigoted and negative views about LGBTQ people, but would uphold the law once the owner served, seated, and charged a same-sex couple in the same way as everyone else. The core requirement in the 'public accommodations' law in question (Title 42, Chapter 21, Subchapter II of the U.S. Code) states that: All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin. The Equality Act would insert 'sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity)' after 'religion.' Any establishments subject to those requirements would not have to accept certain beliefs about sexual orientation and gender identity, but they wouldn't be able to treat potential customers or clients differently, on that basis. 2. 'The Equality Act will legislate that we allow boys in girls' sports, boys in girls' locker rooms, men in women's shelters, and men in women's prisons. It will force teachers and students to publicly pretend that a biological male is a female ...' MOSTLY TRUE: The bill would legally oblige schools and public establishments to accommodate transgender persons in accordance with their preferred gender identity. Graham's description of 'men in women's shelters' only pertains if one denies the validity of transgender identity itself, as a whole. Graham's reference to 'boys in girls' sports' makes it clear that he denies the validity and integrity of transgender identity itself, and the reference to 'pretending' suggests he believes everyone else is of the same mind. Nonetheless, the legislation would indeed require that places of public accommodation, which are specified to include shelters, as well as public schools, would be obliged to accommodate transgender individuals in accordance with their professed gender identity. The Equality Act does not explicitly address questions like bathroom and changing-room accommodations, but existing federal court precedents have held that misgendering students, employees and other individuals, and failing to give them access to facilities in accordance with their gender identity, amounts to sex-based discrimination. With gender identity included as a protected trait, along with race, religion and others, the Equality Act would therefore codify those protections, and require public schools and places of public accommodation to honor the gender identity of transgender individuals, whether employees, students, customers and clients, or members of the public. 3. 'The Equality Act will use the force of law across all 50 states to strip Christian and other religious ministries of their right to hire people of shared faith to pursue a shared mission.' MIXTURE: The bill would not change or repeal an existing exemption in civil rights law, which allows religious organizations to discriminate in favor of individuals of the same religion or religious values in their employment practices. However, by removing the ability of religious employers to invoke another 'conscience protection' - the Religious Freedom Restoration Act - in litigation, the Equality Act would automatically weaken their hand in potential future court cases, and therefore indirectly make it more likely that federal judges rule against them if they seek to assert their right to make employment decisions in accordance with their religious ethos. The legislation explicitly changes Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act, adding 'sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity)' to the following proscription: It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin... The bill would therefore appear to create a blanket ban on any workplace discrimination based on an individual's perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity. However, Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act comes with a religious exemption, which states that: This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to ... a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities. We did not find anything in the text of the Equality Act that would directly affect or neutralize that religious exemption for religious employers when it comes to hiring and firing. However in an email to Snopes, a spokesperson for Graham argued that the implementation of the Equality Act would itself change judges' interpretation of federal non-discrimination law, as a whole, in potential future litigation: If the Equality Act is passed as is, Congress would be effectively and emphatically stating that religious freedom must be weakened and narrowed, especially when it conflicts with sexual orientation protections. ... The Equality Act applies to all 50 states and adds the specific protected classes of sexual orientation and gender identity with the imprimatur of Congress, so if the bill is passed, many judges will begin to emphasize the newly accepted SOGI categories over religious freedom. Additionally, the Equality Act would strip away another major 'conscience protection' - the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which we examine in greater detail in the next section. By doing so, it would mean that judges would no longer be obliged to apply a standard known as 'strict scrutiny' when evaluating whether a particular law or official action has violated an individual or entity's constitutionally protected right to the free exercise of their religious faith. Notwithstanding the continued existence of the religious exemption in Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act, stripping away RFRA would weaken the hand of, for example, a religious employer making employment decisions based on their religious ethos, if they subsequently become embroiled in a court battle. 4. 'The Equality Act will strip health professionals of their rights of conscience. It will force doctors and medical professionals who long to do no harm to engage in gender transition treatments such as hormone-blocking, cross-sex hormones, or surgery.' TRUE: The bill explicitly removes a major 'conscience protection' in the form of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and appears to leave healthcare workers who object to gender transition and reassignment treatments for religious reasons without a robust legal defense. As we have already outlined, the bill explicitly designates any 'establishment that provides health care' as a public accommodation, and therefore subjects hospitals (and by extension their employees) to prohibitions against discrimination based on sex, which would be newly defined as including sexual orientation and gender identity. So health care practitioners could fall foul of the law if, for non-medical reasons, they refuse to take part in procedures or treatments related to gender transition and reassignment, but don't refuse to take part in other procedures or treatments, or don't refuse to take part in the same procedure in different circumstances - for example, performing a hysterectomy for a cisgender woman, but refusing to perform the same procedure for a transgender man as part of gender transition. Historically, businesses have - at least in principle - been able to avail themselves of a defense against such non-discrimination requirements - the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). That law was signed by then-President Bill Clinton in 1993 with widespread bipartisan support in Congress. It requires that the federal government can only 'substantially burden' an individual's constitutionally protected exercise of their religion if a 'compelling governmental interest' exists, and the imposition on the individual's religious freedom is the 'least restrictive' way of advancing that compelling interest. RFRA famously played a key role in the landmark 2014 Supreme Court case Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, in which the owners of the craft store chain Hobby Lobby successfully argued that RFRA applied to secular, for-profit businesses, and allowed them to object, for personal religious reasons, to providing their employees access to free contraception as part of their company health insurance, a requirement under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The Equality Act explicitly seeks to strip away RFRA as the basis for a legal challenge to the non-discrimination requirements set out in the bill. Section 9 of the legislation states: 'The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.' RFRA is not the only legal 'conscience protection' historically available to health care practitioners and providers, but the others primarily relate to faith-based objections to abortion, specifically. In light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock vs Clayton County, the Equality Act's move to neutralize RFRA would appear to leave health care workers who object to procedures and treatments connected to gender transition without a robust legal defense. 5. 'The Equality Act will be a tool used by the government to deny or threaten accreditation to religious colleges and universities if they do not satisfy the demands of the secular Left to apply sexual orientation and gender identity to dorms, sports, places of privacy, and even teachings.' MIXTURE: By integrating sexual orientation and gender identity into Title VI non-discrimination rules, the bill could ultimately leave religious colleges open to being cut off from federal assistance. It would not in itself cause them to lose their accreditation, but it could indirectly prompt accrediting agencies to usher in their own new non-discrimination standards. If a religious institution fails or refuses to abide by those rules, it could ultimately leave itself open to losing its accreditation, at least with that particular agency, and thereby also its eligibility for federal aid. Setting aside the rhetorical flourishes, this appears to be a somewhat accurate representation of the text of the bill, and its legal consequences, although it appears to confuse the link between a school or college's accreditation and its receipt of federal funding. Section 6 of the Equality Act changes Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discriminatory practices by entities and programs that receive federal assistance, including schools and colleges. At present, the core requirement in Title VI is that: No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance The Equality Act would add 'sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity)' to the list of protected traits, along with race and so on. Educational institutions that engage in discriminatory practices do so at the risk of losing access to federal funding and assistance. Since the Equality Act, combined with the court precedents we discussed above, would effectively make it impermissible discrimination for schools and colleges not to accommodate transgender students according to their preferred gender identity, then failing or refusing to provide those accommodations could, in principle, ultimately lead the government to cut off federal assistance to those institutions. However, it would not, in and of itself, cause them to lose their accreditation. Generally speaking, a school or college requires proper accreditation to receive federal assistance, but does not need to receive federal assistance in order to be accredited. However, an independent accrediting agency might have its own standards by which a Title VI or other non-discrimination violation triggers a loss of accreditation. If the Equality Act prompts accrediting agencies to introduce new standards that bar discrimination against LGBTQ individuals (understood to require recognizing the validity and dignity of same-sex relationships and accommodating individuals in accordance with their preferred gender identity), then religious institutions that fail or refuse to meet those standards could ultimately find their accreditation threatened. In turn, that could lead them to lose access to federal assistance.

Although it's difficult to gauge how widespread or pervasive this practice might be in China, a few western news articles have made mention of it in recent years. The UK's Sun tabloid, for example, carried a brief item about goldfish key fobs being sold as souvenirs during the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing:A cruel trader in China shows how he is cashing in on this summer's Olympics - by selling live goldfish as souvenir key fobs. The fish, sold in tiny sealed plastic bags which bear the Beijing Games mascot, have just hours to live before running out of air. Animal rights campaigners have reacted with fury - but in China the gruesome gimmicks are selling fast. The keyrings are being sold mainly to children in Qingdao, the city hosting the sailing events.In April 2011, a Dubai news source briefly referenced an Asian report on the phenomenon:Live fish and turtles sealed in small key rings sold in subway entrances and train stations in China have got animal protection groups up in arms, reports 'Asiaone'. Filled with coloured water, each seven centimetre-long key ring, sold at Sihuiv subway station, encapsulated either one Brazil turtle or two small kingfish. The vendors claim the water in the rings have nutrients and so the fish can live for months. Some clients buying the key rings claim it brings them good luck, while a few others buy to free the animals.That same month, the New Zealand Herald also referenced a Chinese news report about the live animal key rings:Animal rights groups are appalled by a new popular trinket being sold on the streets of China - live animal key rings. The key rings are attached to a bag filled with coloured water containing either a live Brazil turtle or two small fish. Vendors spoken to by China's Global Times claimed the water contained nutrients and that the animal could live for months, however the animal would suffocate sooner because of a lack of oxygen, animal rights activists say. Online petitions calling for the key rings to be banned have been launched - but the gimmicks are completely legal due to China's lack of animal cruelty laws. Qin Xiaona, director of the NGO Capital Animal Welfare Association, described the trinkets as 'immoral and pure animal abuse' - but said they were legal. 'China only has a Wild Animal Protection Law,' Qin told The Global Times. 'If the animals are not wild animals they fall outside the law's scope.' One woman spoken to by the paper said she planned to free the creature, while a man in his 30s was going to hang the key ring, containing a turtle, on the wall in his office. 'It looks nice and brings good luck,' he said.The web site of Phoenix radio station KTAR echoed the other news reports in noting that the bagged fish and turtles sold as key fobs would soon die if not released from their packaging, and that China lacks animal protection laws restricting such practices:The latest fad in China is horrifying animal rights activists. Vendors are selling key rings filled with small turtles and fish that are still alive. That has outraged PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 'They are a form of extreme cruelty,' said PETA's Lyndsey Wright. 'These key chains provide no way to feed the animals and no way for them to breathe. Fish and turtles, they both need oxygen to breathe. No matter what these vendors are telling people about the water, these animals are bound to die in a matter of days, if not hours, after people take them home.' The turtles, Wright said, are 'red sliders,' a shy and sensitive breed. 'Being sealed in a tiny plastic bag full of water and jostled around would be terrifying for any animal, but especially for one of these sensitive turtles if they turn out to be red sliders.' The key chains are really nothing new, Wright said. 'Back in 2008, they were selling Olympic key chains with goldfish inside of them. Sadly, this practice is entirely legal in China because there are virtually no animal protection laws there at all.'

34796,102554,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/sep/19/paul-ryan/ryan-says-four-times-many-people-quit-job-hunting-/, ,0,0,,,"The latest Labor Department jobs report, issued Sept. 7, 2012, was another disappointment: Only 96,000 jobs added nationwide. That was below the projections from various economists that 125,000 jobs would be added. The report, which was issued one day after the Democratic National Convention, became The Story for the presidential campaign -- at least for that day. In an interview with CNBC, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, blamed President Barack Obama for the state of employment. 'This is not even close to what a recovery looks like,' Ryan said. Ryan noted that there must be 150,000 jobs created just to keep in pace with population growth, and blamed 'bad fiscal policy' from the Obama administration for the disappointing results. Then he offered this observation: 'For every person who got a job, nearly four people stopped looking for a job.' Now that makes it all sound even more discouraging. Is Ryan right? The Labor Department report report said that 12.5 million people were out of work in August, a number that was little changed from the previous month. But the figure Ryan seized upon is less-noticed. It's the labor force participation rate and its monthly fluctuations are seen by some as a barometer about how the unemployed are viewing their job prospects. If they're discouraged enough, they drop out of the labor force and report that they are not only unemployed but not actively seeking work. That, in turn, affects the unemployment rate, which in August dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 percent. In other words, the way the unemployment rate is tallied, it could fall even if no one found a new job, and instead more people stopped looking. It also does not count people who, for instance, go back to college for more training to get a better job. In August, the labor force participation declined by 0.2 percent, or about 370,000 people, the Labor Department reported. And that's the number at the center of Ryan's claim. His statement notes that the increase in the number of people who have a job (96,000) is about a fourth of the number of people who dropped out of the labor force. Ryan repeated the statement Sept, 9, 2012 on CBS' 'Face the Nation'. It's an unconventional way to parse the monthly report, but other Republican leaders and conservative pundits have used a similar approach.

'Labor force participation rates have fallen 2.5 percentage points, to 63.5 percent, since December 2007. That is the lowest rate since 1981-- a time when far fewer women worked. ' Sherk concluded that the adult male work force has hit an all-time low of 72.7 percent, a fifth of which is due to factors such as the retirement of Baby Boomers. 'The poor economy has caused the rest,' he said. Others economists have said retirements have played a larger role -- that people are retiring rather than simply giving up on a job hunt. The Huffington Post quoted a Barclays Capital economist Michael Gapen as saying the bank didn't expect the participation rate to rebound 'any time soon and its decline is mainly driven by the ageing (sic) of the population and the exit of the baby boomers from the labor market.' 'Therefore, the decline in the unemployment rate is not reflective of underlying strength in employment in this report, ' Gapen said. In March 2011, the Congressional Budget Office said the retirement of Baby Boomers 'will cause the potential labor force participation rate to decline throughout the next decade.'

A recent Facebook post seeks to build on that false narrative. 'Nancy Pelosi being 'escorted' out of a restaurant, drunk again! Is this the way the 3rd in line to the Presidency should act?,' said the caption of a photo posted Jan. 31 on Facebook. The photo shows Pelosi, a Democrat from California, walking on a sidewalk seemingly with the help of a woman. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo shared on Facebook first appeared Sept. 16, 2016, alongside three other photos on a blog post headlined: 'Nancy Pelosi Shops in Hartford.' The blog is run by Dennis House, a TV news anchor in Hartford. 'One of the most powerful women in Washington was in Hartford this Friday and spent about an hour or so shopping at one of Connecticut's oldest stores,' said the post on dennishouse.tv. 'Stackpole, Moore and Tryon has had its share of prominent shoppers ever since it opened in 1909, including House Minority Leader and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.' The blog post said Pelosi was greeted by the store owner, Jody Morneault, and that Pelosi was later 'escorted to a waiting SUV by Morneault and a government security detail. The two hugged before Pelosi was whisked away.' The blog post does not say that Pelosi was escorted out of a restaurant drunk. The other photos in the blog post feature an SUV parked outside the Stackpole Moore Tryon storefront, Pelosi smiling as she and Morneault walk out of the store, and Pelosi smiling and waving before boarding the SUV. The store's Twitter and Facebook page have posts dating at least to 2013 showing Pelosi visiting the Connecticut store. In May 2019, as an altered video of Pelosi purportedly slurring went viral, her daughter, Christine Pelosi, rebuked the video in a tweet: 'Republicans and their conservative allies have been pumping this despicable fake meme for years!

North Carolina's tax code saw a wide array of changes in 2013 under Tillis' leadership. We found that changes to the income tax code reduced taxes for everyone, but much more for wealthier people than lower-income people. Additionally, sales tax expansions, less government revenue and eliminating the state EITC are especially burdensome on poorer people. But some changes -- such as the increased child credit for lower-income tax filers and the possibility of more jobs and business due to lowered corporate tax rates -- could benefit the whole. 'Overwhelmingly' is a strong word. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.","Controversial changes to North Carolina's tax code passed under Thom Tillis' leadership are now a target in his Senate campaign. In 2013, the North Carolina government received national attention for a wave of conservative legislation. The Republican-dominated General Assembly -- with Tillis as speaker of the House -- passed laws increasing voter ID requirements, lowering business regulations, upping restrictions on abortion providers, tightening education spending and trimming unemployment benefits. Now, Patriot Majority USA, a liberal political action committee, has released a television ad saying Tillis' policies have disproportionately benefited the wealthy. The ad notes in particular the tax legislation enacted last summer -- which Tillis touts in his campaign against incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad says Tillis is cozy with Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who cofounded Americans for Prosperity, an influential conservative PAC. And his policies are designed to benefit people like them. 'Thom Tillis thinks the wealthy, like the Koch brothers, deserve tax breaks, while teachers get a pay freeze,' the ad says. 'Tillis thinks corporations like the ones owned by the Koch brothers should also get tax breaks, while seniors see their pensions taxed and pay more for prescription drugs. Thom Tillis: He may not be a Koch brother, but he certainly treats them like family.' At one point, text on the screen says the Tillis tax plan will 'overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.' We looked into it and found that the law does not overtly harm those at lower-income levels, but the wealthy reap more of the benefits. Let's go to the numbers. Income taxes Supporters of the tax plan most often point to the reduced income tax rate, which they say cuts taxes for people in every income bracket. That's true. However, people in higher-income brackets get bigger cuts than those in the lowest brackets. The income tax part of the law sets the rate for everyone at 5.75 percent. Previously, the state had a graduated three-tier system, with rates of 6 percent for the lowest earners, and rates of 7 percent and 7.75 percent for higher earners. The lowest earners' tax rates shrunk only marginally -- 0.25 points, while higher earners' rates went down 1.25 and 2 points, respectively. Lower earners get a small break, though, in the income tax changes. The child tax credit goes from $100 to $125 per child for those earning below $40,000. The North Carolina Legislature's Fiscal Research Division calculated how much people in various scenarios would owe on average based on the changes to the income tax (other tax changes not included). Here's a sample of what they found: In none of the scenarios examined by the Fiscal Research Division do people owe more in income taxes than they did under the previous tax code. But some benefit more than others. 'There's no question who benefits the most -- the people at the upper end of the income distribution,' said Lawrence Zelenak, a tax law professor at the Duke University School of Law, which is in North Carolina. 'For most people, it hardly makes any difference. But the people who get the major decrease have incomes of $200,000 or more.' Other changes Critics say the new tax law also disproportionately benefits the wealthy because the Legislature did not renew -- effectively eliminating -- the State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. In 2011, about 907,000 North Carolina tax filers claimed the state EITC, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a liberal advocacy group. The maximum credit ranges between $24 for a single person and $302 for a family with three or more children. Additionally, the Legislature expanded the sales tax base -- making more goods and services subject to the tax, which everyone pays regardless of income. The tax base widened to include natural gas, electricity and some entertainment services, including admissions charges. The law also eliminated North Carolina's sales tax holidays and several sales tax exemptions, such as those for newspapers, vending machines and meals sold in schools. Opponents of raising the sales tax and other regressive taxes say they are unfairly burdensome on lower-income people because a higher percentage of their income is subject to these taxes than wealthier people. For example, if two people -- one making $500 a week and the other making $2,000 a week -- spend $100 each on groceries, the person with the lower income is spending a greater share of their income on these taxed items than the person with a higher income. It's worth noting that in 2011 -- Tillis' first year as speaker -- the Legislature reduced sales tax rates from 5.75 percent to 4.75 percent. Tillis and other Republicans also say the new law's reductions in corporate tax rates (down from 6.9 percent to 5 percent, and 3 percent if certain parameters are met) will bring business and jobs to North Carolina, which will benefit everyone and bring in more revenue over the long term. In total, the new tax code will reduce tax-collected revenue by about $684 million between 2013 and 2015, according to the Fiscal Research Division. Less revenue means less money for the state to spend on social programs, which hurts people in low income brackets, Zelenak said. Even if the law does not obviously harm poor people, this is a possible indirect effect.",,,,A tax plan promoted by North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis will 'overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact
8504,12809,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/morgan-freeman-electric-company/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Actor Morgan Freeman has played a wide range of characters during his decades-long career. While the Oscar-winning actor is best known for roles in major motion pictures such as 'The Shawshank Redemption,' 'Se7en,' and 'Million Dollar Baby,' Freeman has also had some smaller parts on some television shows. In the 1970s, for instance, Freeman played 'Easy Reader' on the children's show 'The Electric Company.' This interesting tidbit goes viral from time to time as social media users share images from one of Freeman's lesser-known roles: This is a real image of Morgan Freeman on 'The Electric Company,' a children's television program produced by PBS that was aimed at children who had outgrown 'Sesame Street.' Freeman made regular appearances on the show during its run between 1971 and 1976 where he played a variety of characters, such as 'Count Dracula,' 'Marcello,' 'Easy Reader,' and the above-pictured 'Mel Mounds.' This image comes from the 26th episode of the Electric Company that originally aired in November 1971. Here's a clip of Freeman's Mel Mounds as he teaches kids about the 'br' sound as found in the name 'Brenda Bradley.' In 'The Amazing Life Of Morgan Freeman,' author Matt Green writes that Freeman was largely working in stage plays around the time he auditioned for 'The Electric Company.' At the audition, Freeman was shown a variety of sketches of colorful puppet characters and went over-the-top in his audition performance, trying to captivate the silly nature of the television show. His zaniness ended up landing him the role. In 1971, Freeman debuted on The Electric Company, a puppet-based children's show that used sketch comedy to try to present basic educational content for elementary age children. On the show, Freeman played various comedic characters, often having to interact with puppets and animated characters. The Electric Company had a talented cast bolstering it, including already-famous Bill Cosby and Rita Moreno. Young up-and-coming actors and comedians such as Joan Rivers and Gene Wilder also appeared in some of the sketches. Freeman was given some memorable characters, such as an exaggerated portrayal of Count Dracula. All in all, however, he felt as if his career was somewhat grounded. Freeman's stage work continued to be successful, garnering him critical praise and a slew of Drama Desk and Tony Award nominations. However, though the Electric Company was steady work with a cast of successful fellow actors, it was doing little to advance Freeman towards his lifelong goal of appearing in the feature films he used to enjoy as a boy. Few casting agents for more serious material were perusing episodes of children television to look for potential new stars. When the Electric Company as canceled in 1976, Freeman felt as if were back at square one with his acting career, still having to scrape by at odd jobs and go to audition after fruitless audition. Here's another clip from 'The Electric Company' featuring Freeman as the character 'Easy Reader.' In 2018, Freeman appeared on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' and talked to the TV host about his time on 'The Electric Company':",Was Morgan Freeman on 'The Electric Company'?

Hegar Democratic nominee, 31st Congressional District of Texas https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/politics/2018/08/21/candidate-conversation--mj-hegar Round Rock, Texas Tuesday, August 21, 2018 2018-08-21 Read More info","Has a Central Texas congressman not hosted a 'town hall' meeting for half a decade? Democrat M.J. Hegar of Round Rock says as much about the Republican she's challenging to represent the state's 31st Congressional District, eight-term Rep. John Carter of Round Rock. The district, north of Austin, sweeps in Williamson and Bell counties. Hegar, a decorated Air Force veteran, has promoted her candidacy with a video in which she says that she once tried but failed to land a meeting with Carter about lifting the ban on women to participate in ground combat. 'We'll show him tough,' Hegar says in the video. 'Then we'll show him the door.' Hegar said of Carter in an Aug. 21, 2018 interview on Spectrum News's 'Capital Tonight:' 'He hasn't had a town hall in five years and he's kind of acting as if he wants to retire.' Hegar points to news stories We sought Hegar's factual backup for her claim mindful that Merriam-Webster defines a town hall as 'an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members.' The dictionary makes clear that such a gathering doesn't have to enable anyone to ask anything. Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: 'Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on.' Christian Walker of Hegar's campaign pointed us to a Texas Observer article describing a 2013 town-hall meeting where Carter faced critical questions. Walker also singled out a February 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story quoting a Round Rock resident, Felicia Miyakawa, saying Carter's staff had told her and others that Carter hadn't hosted live town hall meetings since the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at a public meeting with constituents in 2011. Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer responded at the time: 'I wouldn't say that is 'the' reason, but it would be correct to say it contributes to the many reasons. Mostly town halls are not nearly as effective, and you can't reach nearly as many people as a tele-town hall.' One alternative: Mass conference calls. The American-Statesman story said: 'Many members of Congress prefer the safety of tele-town hall meetings, which offer interaction with constituents but in a controlled setting - essentially large-scale conference calls in which hundreds or thousands of people can listen in and queue up to ask a question - with no booing, no signs with clever slogans, no bad headlines, no viral videos.' Carter held an hour-long tele-town hall on March 22, 2017, according to an American-Statesman news blog post. More recently, an Aug. 11, 2018, news story in the newspaper said Carter had reached out to residents through Facebook Live events. Carter: 'Man of the people' When we asked Carter about Hegar's claim, he said by phone that he'd held multiple events attended by people asking questions. 'I've been all over my district now, for 12- to 14-hour days, which is pretty typical of my work in Augusts each year. I would say I'm way ahead of my opponent in the Man-of-the-People category,' Carter said. When we inquired into Carter's formal schedule, we heard back from his office's Emily Taylor. By email, Taylor listed four August 2018 events where, she said, Carter took questions from constituents on topics including federal pensions, Fort Hood and the legalization of marijuana. The events, Taylor said, were hosted by the Temple Kiwanis Club (Aug. 7); American Legion Post 133 (Aug. 14); the Military Officers Association of America (Aug. 17); and the Killeen Chamber of Commerce (Aug. 23). An Aug. 14, 2018 Temple Daily Telegram news story on the American Legion event includes a section titled 'Town Hall' stating that Carter 'took a few minutes to discuss congressional business and field questions from the audience.' We asked if Carter had held public town halls open to all constituents. Taylor replied that Carter had hosted 25 telephone town halls in five years, the latest one on June 18, 2018. 'The last four alone have reached 71,471 constituents,' Taylor wrote. Also, Taylor said, Carter holds Facebook Live 'town halls, where constituents can tune in online and ask real-time questions or submit questions on our website if they're unable to tune in during the live event.' She pointed us to a nearly 20-minute Facebook Live that Carter held July 2, 2018. Such events are publicized, Taylor wrote, through Carter's electronic newsletters.",,,,Says U.S. Rep.

Her campaign said she was referring to purges in 2017 and 2018, which did result in hundreds of thousands of voters being removed from the rolls. But her statement implied that was underway during the debate, which is not the case. Our definition of Mostly False is 'The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.' That fits here.","In the most recent Democratic presidential debate, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she didn't want to keep rehashing the past. Instead, she said, she's focused on the way forward. Klobuchar then went on to outline a series of issues she believes demand attention. One of them was voting rights, and she used Wisconsin to underscore her point. 'While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls,' she said Feb. 25, 2020 in South Carolina. Wisconsin's voter rolls have been front and center in recent months after the state Election Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved, asking them to update their registrations if relevant. The plan was to remove them from the rolls in 2021. That prompted a lawsuit from a conservative law group contending those voters should be taken off the rolls now. The matter ultimately may go to the state Supreme Court. Klobuchar's campaign said she was referring to voter purges in 2017 and 2018 - not those at the center of the lawsuit. But that doesn't explain why she implied it was happening right then. (Note: Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential campaign March 2, 2020, after a sixth-place finish in South Carolina, as we were working on this fact-check. We decided to complete it, since removal of voters from the state's rolls is an ongoing issue.) Let's see where Klobuchar's claim lands. Changes to Wisconsin's voter rolls When asked for evidence for Klobuchar's claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016. This included 44,000 voters in Milwaukee alone. The decline stemmed from two separate actions in 2017 and 2018, according to Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn't voted in four years and didn't respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations. Over half of those voters didn't respond, and roughly 43% of the notices were returned as undeliverable. Some people had died or were deactivated for other reasons. Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency's Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration. Once officials realized there were problems with accuracy of that list, they implemented a supplemental poll book to ensure anyone incorrectly removed could vote without reregistering. The commission later said it found few examples of voters who were removed inappropriately. So, the commission did deactivate hundreds of thousands of voters in 2017 and 2018. But by saying they were 'kicked off,' Klobuchar suggests the motive was voter suppression. Magney disputes that. In any case, Wisconsin has same-day registration, so removal from the rolls does not prevent people from voting, as it might in some states if done too close to election day. The latest election saga There is another problem with Klobuchar's statement: She said Wisconsin has purged voters 'while we are all sitting here debating.' That suggests the issue is immediate - not one from several years ago. As we noted, Wisconsin is currently in the throes of a controversy over its voter rolls. The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, representing three suburban Milwaukee men, filed a lawsuit arguing that 234,000 voters who may have moved and received notices in the mail should be removed from the rolls within 30 days if they don't respond. The commission had said it wouldn't suspend registrations until after April 2021. Critics of the lawsuit believe any voter purge would be an affront to the democratic process and could inadvertently affect voters who didn't even move. The case has drawn heightened attention because of Wisconsin's pivotal role in this year's presidential race. In December 2019, an Ozaukee County judge sided with the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and ordered the election commission to remove those people from the voter rolls. He found the commission and its Democratic members in contempt of court on Jan. 13, 2020 for failing to adhere to his ruling. But one day later, an appeals court ordered voters to be kept on the rolls while it considered whether people should be removed. The court officially struck down the Ozaukee County ruling on Feb. 28, 2020. That means the targeted voters won't be kicked off any time soon.",,,,"'While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls.",refuted,barely-true,<p>U.S. Sen.

Johnny Isakson noted the broad support for the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention For American Veterans Act in an Associated Press article just days before it cleared the Senate and headed to President Barack Obama's desk. 'When you have 8,000 veterans a year committing suicide, then you have a serious problem,' Isakson said. That statistic - based on the math that an average of 22 military veterans take their lives every day - is often repeated by the same broad groups. The AP story that quotes Isakson also cites it. But just how accurate is the figure? PolitiFact Georgia already tackled the problems with the figure in a fact check about 'solider suicides' made by Democratic Congressman David Scott, who represents part of metro Atlanta. Now that the bill is law, the government will repay student loans for psychiatrists who join the Department of Veterans Affairs and also will develop peer support groups and community outreach with veterans' service groups. So what about those veterans? The figures in question come from a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs report released in 2013, based on the most extensive data the agency has collected on veterans' suicide. The study examined death certificates in 21 states, to conclude that veterans accounted for 22 percent of suicides. Applying that percentage to about 38,000 suicides in the United States annually that translates to about 8,300 veteran suicides, or 22 a day. However, it's important to acknowledge the study looked only at 21 states. Georgia was not among them. The death certificates themselves also were imprecise. The report itself acknowledges that about 5 percent of a sub-group of the sample were misidentified as veterans or non-veterans, when checked against VA records. In other words, the figures are an estimate. Although the study was the first analysis of its kind, it does not offer an actual count of the number of veterans who take their own lives. A study published this month does finally offer a specific number, at least for recent veterans. The study published in the February issue of Annals of Epidemiology matched military records of nearly 1.3 million active-duty veterans who served between 2001 and 2007 with the National Death Index. It found 1,868 suicides through the end of 2009. That translates into a rate of one suicide per day for that specific group of recent veterans. So which is accurate -- estimates of 22 suicides daily among all veterans or 1 a day for recent vets? Most likely, both, said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist who specializes in military suicides at the National Institute of Mental Health. Not that either number matters, without a frame of reference. And that's where it gets tricky. Schoenbaum points out 22 or 1 are simply numbers. Their significance is meaningless, until they are applied to how they stack up against comparable non-veterans suicides. There, the data is far more clear. Suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in the United States, with a rate of 12.6 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Both studies, the estimate for all veterans and the actual count of recent veterans, show a much higher rate for veterans. The VA study shows a rate that is 20 percent higher than the civilian population. The most recent study is even more alarming, showing a 50 percent higher rate, with 29.5 deaths per 100,000 veterans. 'To say 22 veterans a day, 8,000 veterans a year, commit suicide, it's a defensible statistic,' Schoenbaum said. 'When people ask me about suicide risk in veterans, I don't talk about that. I talk about rates,' he continued. 'The general insight there is yes, there is something about the veteran population that is leading them to have higher rates of suicide than other people. And I believe we have a national obligation to help them.' Isakson said he knew of 'shortcomings' in the VA data but said the estimates were the best available when he spoke during committee hearings. He made the issue a priority when he took over the committee, he said, because of the need for more attention and information on the issue. 'The intent is to have a number that can reflect that this is an alarming rate, and we must address it, given our obligation to all veterans,' Isakson said. The $22 million in funding is designed to pay that debt, as federal agencies work to compile more accurate data. The VA is working with the Department of Defense, to assemble the Suicide Data Repository, Schoenbaum said. Like the latest study, it will pair death records to military and healthcare records, but for all veterans. 'The reason to do these calculations, to track this data, is to first see if there is a problem. Now we know, there is,' he said. 'The next step is to process where it is. Who is at risk? Why? That requires more data that we don't yet have.' And the information we do have? Isakson said 8,000 veterans are taking their own lives every year. The number comes from a VA study that is statistically reliable, if somewhat lacking context. It is the context that matters here. The number fails to impart the fact that research shows veterans commit suicide at a higher, perhaps much higher, rate than their civilian counterparts. Isakson was correct on the numbers. But there is a bit of context missing in what those numbers mean.

CNN's extrapolation was based on the best official figures available at the time, and although there was a small degree of imprecision in the numbers, a COVID-19 death rate of one death for every 500 people would inevitably be achieved, if not by Sept. 14 itself, then within a matter of a few days. The substantive point of CNN's article was therefore accurate, and we are issuing a rating of 'True.' On Sept. 14, Johns Hopkins did indeed report that a cumulative total of almost 664,000 people had died of COVID-19 in the United States. By the morning of Sept. 15, the figure had risen by 50, to 663,963, as shown below: As CNN correctly reported, the most up-to-date official estimates from the 2020 census - published in August 2021 - showed that the population of the United States in 2020 was estimated to be 331.4 million (331,449,281 to be precise). Those figures - 663,913 deaths in a population of 331.4 million - yield a fatality rate of one COVID-19 death for every 499 people, which is actually a slightly worse death rate than the one in 500 reported by CNN. However, the U.S. population is highly like to have grown between the 2020 census and September 2021. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's population ticker, the total number of people living in the U.S. on Sept. 15, 2021, was estimated to be around 332.7 million: Based on that number, and the slightly increased COVID-19 death total reported by Johns Hopkins on the morning of Sept. 15, the estimated fatality rate was one COVID-19 death for every 501 people - again, almost exactly the rate claimed by CNN. Furthermore, in the days leading up to Sept. 14, the U.S. was adding an average of around 1,200 new COVID-19 deaths per day. Extrapolating roughly from that rate of increase, and the Census Bureau's estimated rate of increase in the overall population (one person added every 25 seconds, or 3,456 added each day), then the U.S. would reach the grim milestone of one COVID-19 death for every 500 people by Sept. 17 or 18. If the average number of new COVID-19 deaths per day is 1,000, then the milestone would be reached by Sept. 18 or 19. If the average daily increase in COVID-19 deaths is 1,500, then the 'one in 500' milestone would be hit even sooner, by Sept. 16 or 17. In conclusion, based on the most up-to-date figures available, the U.S. was bound to reach the milestone of one COVID-19 death for every 500 people, within a few days of Sept. 14, when CNN published its report to that effect. The network's substantive claim was therefore accurate, and we are issuing a rating of 'True.'","Did 1 in 500 US Residents Die From COVID-19 by September 2021?

The first is a 17 September 2004 editorial published in the Daily Nebraskan and entitled 'Individual Rights Buckle Under Seat Belt Laws,' by Derek Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in which the writer inveighed against mandatory seat belt laws, opining that 'Uncle Sam is not here to regulate every facet of life no matter the consequences,' and that 'Democrats and Republicans alike should stand together to stop these laws that are incongruous with the ideals of both parties.' In the midst of his editorial he noted:As laws become increasingly strict for seat belts, fewer people will respond positively by buckling up in response to the laws. There seems to be a die-hard group of non-wearers out there who simply do not wish to buckle up no matter what the government does. I belong to this group.Evidently his words were far more prescient than any of us might have wanted, as an article in the 4 January 2005 Lincoln Journal Star reported that Mr. Kieper not only died in a car crash, but the tragic mishap that claimed his life was the very type of accident in which seat belts have proved so effective in saving lives by preventing passengers from being ejected from vehicles:Derek Kieper was a smart, funny, intense young man who relished a good debate and would do anything for his friends. Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died early Tuesday morning when the Ford Explorer he was a passenger in traveled off an icy section of Interstate 80 and rolled several times in a ditch. Kieper, who was riding in the back seat of the Explorer, was ejected from the vehicle. Two others in the vehicle, including the driver, Luke Havermann of Ogallala, and the front-seat passenger, Nick Uphoff of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, sustained non-life threatening injuries. Havermann and Uphoff, both 21, were being treated at BryanLGH Medical Center West. Derek, who was thrown from the vehicle, was not wearing a seat belt, [Capt. Joe Lefler of the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office] said. He said Havermann and Uphoff were wearing seat belts at the time.In a similar vein, in July 2011 a helmetless motorcyclist participating in a ride to protest mandatory helmet laws was killed when he was thrown over the handlebars of his motorcycle in Onondaga, New York:Philip A. Contos, 55, of Parish, New York, was on a ride organized by the Onondaga chapter of American Bikers Aimed Towards Education (ABATE). Contos hit his brakes, began fishtailing and lost control of his 1983 Harley Davidson. He shot over the handlebars, hit his head on the pavement and was taken to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, where he was pronounced dead. State police say evidence at the scene plus information from the attending medical expert indicated Contos would have survived had he been wearing a helmet as required by state law.",Seat Belt Death,Anti-seat belt law advocate is killed in automobile accident.,"Kieper, Derek.

Owning a sex robot that can make you dinner and clean your home for you. Right, guys? That's the grim and unimaginative premise of a fake, January 2018 post on the 'satirical' Huzlers web site, which falsely reported that technology companies had been leaking their plans to produce and sell just such a machine by 2019. According to reports, tech companies that are producing realistic sex robots are trying to reach the next level in creating sex robots that can cook and clean. Company spokesperson's say the cooking and cleaning sex robots can be available for purchase as soon as next year. Despite citing 'reports,' the article does not include any specific sources, and we could find no corroboration for a specific plan to market an automaton that cooks and cleans as well as providing sexual gratification, by 2019. The article goes on to quote 'Jan Kunchai,' an engineer at RealBotix. RealBotix is an actual company, known for creating the sex robot 'Harmony,' but we couldn't find any evidence of a 'Jan Kunchai' working there. Inventors and designers have been working on developing sex robots for years, and companies like RealBotix have produced prototypes that could actualize what had previously been only theoretical plans or non-functioning prototypes. At the same time, British company Moley Robotics has come up with a prototype for a robotic kitchen, which consists of two robotic arms that can carry out a recipe stored in its memory based on 3-D videos of the movements made by a human. According to the company, the kitchen is scheduled to go on sale to the public in 2018. Robot vacuum cleaners (like the Roomba) and mopping robots are already available on the market, although they are limited to fairly basic functions and can't navigate any surface other than a floor. A fully-functioning, human-like robot that can cook, clean and provide sexual gratification is a theoretical possibility, but the technological sophistication required to produce one is not even close to being in place, and certainly won't be by 2019. That's not to mention the many ethical dilemmas presented by the prospect of such an invention. The article is no more than a hoax based on a bad joke.

In May 2020, the image above circulated on social media supposedly showing a highway leading to Dubai covered with sand after weeks of inactivity due to lockdown orders put in place during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. This is not a genuine photograph. It's a composite of at least two images, and the location it supposedly shows does not even exist. Roads near Dubai (and other desert locales) truly can get covered in sand after storms, which can lead to some spectacular images. Photographer Irenaeus Herok, for instance, has captured several aerial pictures of real sand-covered highways near Dubai, such as this one from 2016: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Irenaeus Herok (@iherok) on Dec 4, 2016 at 9:54am PST The YouTube page 'Drone Collective' has also posted several videos of such sand-covered roads in Dubai: However, the scene depicted in the viral photograph - a two-lane highway stretching unimpeded into the distance as the skyline of Dubai rests on the horizon - does not exist. For starters, no such lengthy stretch of desert highway leading in and out of Dubai lines up perfectly with the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, as shown in the viral image. Secondly, while we have encountered a number of similar images supposedly showing a sand-covered highway leading to Dubai, these images were digital composites. In other words, they were created by taking at least two distinct images and then editing them together. The trick apparently is to take a drone photograph of a long stretch of partially sand-covered desert highway and then to photoshop the skyline of Dubai into the background. A number of travel photographers have made their own versions of this scene, including Husain Ujjainwala, a photographer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who posted a 'before and after' version of his edit. Here's how this stretch of highway looked in Ujjainwala's original photograph (left) and after it was edited (right) to include the Dubai skyline: Ujjainwala captured these images: 'Instagram Vs Reality. Not everything you see on Instagram is real.' These fake Dubai skyline images often circulate on social media as if they are genuine photographs. This has inspired a few adventurous photographers, such as Ty Poland, a writer for the photography website FStoppers, to set out for Dubai in order to capture this tremendous view. Unfortunately, this scene can only be captured via photo-editing software. Poland wrote an article entitled 'Discovering Fake Dubai: A Road That Led to Nowhere' on FStoppers in 2018 after an amazing, yet somewhat disappointing, visit to Dubai: '... I've seen photos like this so many times on my Instagram over the past three years or so. I said to myself that if I ever get to go to Dubai, I want to do my own version of this photo. When I got out there, I tried to do just that. After spending some time on Google maps looking for where this road could be, Martin and I decided to take it or leave it and head to the location we thought this one spot could be. As we rolled up, we noticed the road was blocked off and the area seemed to be restricted. There was not a shot we would be able to get to that spot. We went back to check Google for more spots with this potential view, but soon discovered that we had been fooled by other photos of 'fake' Dubai. Every time I saw these pictures, I thought they were real. I'd always wonder how these people got onto these roads covered by this sand with such a beautiful iconic view. For me, it kind of hurt to find out it we'd been fooled, but it allowed me to create a scene of my own and actually plan to do it. Poland posted his version of this scene on Instagram along with the caption 'Finding places that don't exist' and the hashtag #photoshop: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ty Poland (@typoland) on Oct 10, 2018 at 3:49pm PDT As we investigated this photograph, we kept coming across comments that asked what city officials in Dubai did to clear the roads of sand after a storm. Did they have sand plows? An army of shovel-wielding sand clearers? The answer to both of those questions, generally speaking, is yes. In 2012, shortly after a sandstorm left many of Dubai's roads covered in sand, The National in UAE reported that Dubai used road-sweeping machines and manual labor in order to clear the roads: Municipal workers were kept busy all weekend shoveling tones of sand from choked highways and arterial roads. 'We had to work like an emergency team to remove the sand in time,' said Yaqoob Al Ali, the head of Dubai Municipality's cleaning section. 'It was a big challenge to get the highways clear. 'We cannot leave sand on the highways or accidents will happen. It is a danger zone. During a sandstorm people cannot control the car. It skids and slips because drivers cannot tell how deep the sand is.'",Is This a Sand-Covered Highway to Dubai During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

15913,3165,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colorado-voting-photo-id/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In April 2021, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that it was moving the upcoming All-Star Game out of Georgia in response to the state's new restrictive voter law and would instead be hosting the game at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. Shortly after this news broke, political pundits started posting messages comparing the voter laws in Denver to Georgia's new voter law. The National Review, for instance, wrote: Another funny way of showing your concern for alleged 'voting restrictions' is by moving the All-Star Game to a state that in many ways has voting laws at least as stringent as Georgia's. To vote in Colorado, a person needs photo identification, just as they do at the will-call window at Coors Field. But in the very next sentence, the Review confusingly added: 'Like Colorado, Georgia allows voters without ID to use the last four digits of their Social Security number, a bank statement or utility bill, a paycheck, or any other government document with their name and address.' Furthermore, the Review linked to Colorado's Secretary of State website, which confirmed that people can use a 'copy of a current (within the last 60 days) utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the elector' as a form of identification. In other words, a Colorado voter may use any of several forms of identification, including some without a photo, in order to vote. Republican communicator Matt Whitlock also shared an incomplete list of Colorado's voter-ID requirements: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp even made the erroneous claim about photo IDs during an appearance on Fox News. Kemp said: They have 15 [days of in-person voting]. We have 17. They have a photo ID requirement for in-person voting as we do. To be clear, Colorado does not require photo ID to vote in person. While Kemp is right to say that Georgia has more days for in-person voting than Colorado, he failed to mention that Colorado is an all-mail voting state, which means that every eligible voter in Colorado receives a mail-in ballot before an election. While people still have the option to vote in person if they chose to (and can register the same day as the election), the vast majority of voters choose to vote by mail. In 2020, more than 99% of Colorado's vote arrived via mail. It should also be noted that Georgia's new voting law is close to 100 pages and deals with far more than voter-ID requirements. Colorado Public Radio reported on some of the ways that Georgia's new voting law differs from the voting laws in Colorado: Georgia's new law moves the state away from Colorado's vote-by-mail approach, pushing more voters to show up in person. For example, under the new law, Georgia elections officials can only mail out absentee applications to voters who individually request it, shutting down one approach to encouraging mail balloting. And voters will have a shorter window to ask for those ballots. (Georgia sent out absentee applications to millions of voters in the 2020 primary, even if they hadn't requested it, to encourage absentee voting during the pandemic.) The Georgia law also bans mobile voting centers, and it strictly limits the use of dropboxes. This is another area where Colorado is moving in the opposite direction. Colorado had one dropbox per 9,400 active registered voters for the last election, with the Secretary of State boasting about adding scores of new locations in the past few years. In Georgia, it's capped at one box per 100,000 active registered voters. The metropolitan Atlanta area could see its number of dropboxes drop from 94 to 23, The New York Times reported. And, instead of being outdoors with 24-hour access, as many in Colorado are, the Georgia boxes must be inside government buildings and voting sites. The Georgia Recorder also noted a few of the differences between the election laws in Colorado and Georgia. Here's how the local outlet explained the difference between Georgia and Colorado's voter identification requirements: Colorado doesn't require voter ID for mail-in ballots. Georgia just passed such a requirement. Republicans have seized upon the fact that Colorado requires ID for voters who vote in person, equating it with Georgia's voter ID law, which was enacted in 2005. But the vast majority of Coloradans don't need to show an ID in order to vote; last year, more than 94% of Colorado voters cast their ballots by returning them through the mail or in drop boxes, according to election-night data from the Colorado Secretary of State's office. Colorado does require ID in order to register to vote, but the state accepts a wider range of forms of identification, including non-photo IDs like pay stubs and utility bills, than Georgia does. Among the most controversial changes made by Georgia's new election law is to require voter ID for absentee ballots - a requirement that doesn't exist in Colorado, which uses signature verification to validate mail-in ballots. While one could pick and choose portions of Georgia's law and compare them to the laws in other states, the overarching criticism of Georgia's new voting law is that it restricts voting access - by, for example, limiting the number of absentee ballot drop boxes and diminishing the time voters have to request absentee ballots - and that it was passed with votes solely from the political party (Republicans) that just lost two U.S. Senate seats (and a presidency) during an election that saw record-breaking turnout. This law was also passed in the aftermath of an election that was marred by false claims about voter fraud. While Georgia legislators wrote in the new voting bill that the legislation was needed because 'there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems,' the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and other election officials previously called the 2020 election 'the most secure in American history.'","Does Colorado Require Photo ID To Vote In Person?

It's an even greater mistake to suppose that Farrakhan renounced Islam. Here's a tweet he composed barely a month after delivering the above address: You have to know and believe that Allah is sufficient for all our needs. - MINISTER FARRAKHAN (@LouisFarrakhan) September 3, 2017 We reached out to the Nation of Islam for comment on this rumor, but have not yet received a reply.","In August 2017, various online sources reported that Louis Farrakhan, the 84-year-old leader of the Chicago-based religious group Nation of Islam, had posted a video on his Facebook page in which he declared Jesus as his redeemer, seemingly contradicting his own Muslim teachings. For example, the Christian Post stated: Reflecting on his inevitable physical death, leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, 84, declared in a controversial video recording Tuesday that Jesus will save him from the grip of death despite his organization's creed that there is only 'One God whose proper Name is Allah.' The declaration came the same day Farrakhan was shown visiting Bishop Larry Trotter, longtime pastor of Chicago's Sweet Holy Spirit Church, who was hospitalized last Wednesday with a 'serious illness' following a trip to Israel. 'I thank God for guiding me for 40 years absent my teacher (Elijah Muhammad). So my next journey will have to answer the question. I'm gonna say it,' Farrakhan teased briefly in the clip before declaring: 'I know that my redeemer liveth.' Similarly, Dan Calabrese of Canada Free Press wrote: Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is 84 years old. We all know the Islamic radicalism and racial division he's been preaching for decades, so there's no reason to go over it in detail here. But what's this? Farrakhan released this video yesterday, and if it's what it appears to be on first glace, he's made quite a radical change of direction: My first instinct was to find a loophole in his wording. When Farrakhan said 'my Jesus lives' and emphasized the 'my,' I thought maybe he was trying to give himself license to declare that his 'redeemer' can be whoever he wants it to be, and that he could express that by referring to said redeemer as 'my Jesus.' That would be more consistent with the way Farrakhan has expressed himself throughout his public life. But what about this? 'I say to the devil, I know I gotta pay a price for what I've been teaching all these years. You can have the money, you can have the clothes, you can have the suit, you can have the house but, me, you can't have.' If that doesn't sound like full-throated repentence, I don't know what does. And, according to Black Christian News: Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has declared that Jesus Christ is his 'Redeemer' and has indicated that he knows he will have to 'pay' for his false teachings. In a video released Tuesday, while reflecting on his inevitable death, the 84-year-old religious teacher said, 'I thank God for guiding me for forty years absent my teacher [Elijah Muhammad]. So my next journey will have to answer the question. I'm gonna say it: I know that my redeemer liveth.' He emphasized, 'I know. I'm not guessing that my Jesus is alive. I know that my redeemer liveth and because he lives I know that I, too, will pass through the portal of death yet death will not afflict me.' The video clip is authentic, released via Farrakhan's multiple social media accounts. However, the interpretation of his words as a sign of a deep change in his belief system - specifically, as a turning away from or renunciation of Islam and a conversion, tentative or complete, to Christianity - is erroneous and disproven by other statements he has made before and since. Regarding the excerpt itself, the clip represents a minute and a half of a speech that lasted an hour and 41 minutes. Farrakhan said a great many things during the 30 July 2017 talk, which was delivered from the pulpit of the Union Temple Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. on the occasion of the 40th pastoral anniversary of his friend, the Rev. Willie Wilson: Among other things, Farrakhan repeated the phrase 'I am a Muslim' several times, reminded his audience that Muslims revere Jesus (who is named in the Qur'an itself as a prophet and the Messiah), and expressed the belief, as he has on past occasions, that the appointed role of the Messiah is to deliver black people from oppression by white people, whom he believes are Satanically created and inspired. Going deeper, Farrakhan's writings and speeches indicate he believes that the Messiah prophesied in the Torah, the Qur'an, and the Bible - the figure to whom he refers as 'my redeemer' - is, in fact, former Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, who died in 1975, but whom Farrakhan believes is still 'physically alive': 'I haven't been the same since,' said Min. Farrakhan. 'Because everything that Elijah Muhammad said to me made sense. It would not make sense if he were dead, it could only make since if he's alive and all the things he told me about myself and my future didn't make sense if he was dead. But when I came to see that he was alive, Saviours' Day 1981, I mentioned it.' Confusion also surrounds Farrakhan's statement that 'I know I gotta pay a price for what I've been teaching all these years.' Some have taken it to mean Farrakhan was admitting he will have to repent to God for uttering false teachings (i.e., Islam), but that interpretation ignores the opening of his statement, which begins: 'I say to the devil, I know I gotta pay a price for what I've been teaching all these years.' In context, Farrakhan was speaking of the price he will have to pay for a lifetime of standing up against the false religion ('corrupted' Christianity) invented by Satan and preached by white people to deceive blacks into accepting subjugation and slavery. Farrakhan is saying he knows the devil will extract payment, but there's a limit to what he can take: I say to the devil, I know I gotta pay a price for what I've been teaching all these years. You can have the money, you can have the clothes, you can have the suit, you can have the house but me you can't have. In short, it's a grave mistake to take Louis Farrakhan's pronouncements about Jesus Christ as having the same meaning ordinary Christians (or even Muslims) would give them. It's an even greater mistake to suppose that Farrakhan renounced Islam. Here's a tweet he composed barely a month after delivering the above address: You have to know and believe that Allah is sufficient for all our needs. - MINISTER FARRAKHAN (@LouisFarrakhan) September 3, 2017 We reached out to the Nation of Islam for comment on this rumor, but have not yet received a reply.",Did Louis Farrakhan Renounce Islam and Convert to Christianity?

Any money the state received would be dollars that taxpayers would not have to provide. Taxpayers could get $50 million worth of services or $50 million in tax cuts. Either way, they come out ahead. We rate this claim True.","As part of his campaign to become Missouri's 56th governor, Chris Koster tweeted a statistic about something he has been working to accomplish during his time as attorney general: closing the tobacco loophole. In his tweet, Koster called upon the legislature to #FixTheLoophole, which he says will save Missourians $50 million. The so-called tobacco loophole is money the state hopes to get from five big tobacco companies if it takes a tougher line with smaller ones. We looked into whether $50 million is really on the line. Tobacco background We reached out to the Koster campaign to find out what closing the loophole entailed. We heard back from David Turner, a spokesman for the Missouri Democratic Party. Turner told us that the tobacco loophole arose in 1998 as part of a master settlement agreement between the attorneys general of 46 states, along with Washington, D.C., and five U.S. territories, and the five largest tobacco companies in the U.S. The states had sued the tobacco companies for selling cigarettes which they knew caused cancer, emphysema and other diseases. The attorneys general wanted to recover the cost of caring for those people. The settlement said that in exchange for dropping the lawsuits, the states would receive roughly $10 billion dollars a year, essentially indefinitely. The annual payment to Missouri is about $130 million. As part of the deal, Missouri passed a law that required all nonparticipating tobacco companies to pay into an escrow fund. This was done in part to ensure that small cigarette makers didn't gain a market advantage because they would be able to sell cigarettes at reduced prices. But there was a catch. If a state failed to 'diligently enforce' the requirement that small companies make escrow payments, and the big tobacco companies lost a set amount of market share as a result, that state would lose a portion of its tobacco settlement money. According to a state auditor, that's exactly what happened. The big tobacco companies lost an 8 percent market share from 1997 to 2003. As a result, the companies sued Missouri and other states for violating the settlement. In 2013, an arbitration panel found that in Missouri, of the 432 million cigarettes sold by nonparticipating manufacturers in 2002, companies made escrow payments on only $102 million. The panel ruled against Missouri and five other states, meaning the Show-Me State had to pay back $70 million from its 2014 payment. Which brings us to the loophole. Under current Missouri law, the smaller companies can trim the amount they pay into the escrow fund. Missouri is the only state that has yet to take steps to prevent this. The loophole The way escrow payments are calculated, small tobacco companies can get most of the money they pay back if they restrict their sales to only a few states. In order to close the loophole - and return $50 million to Missouri - the legislature would have to pass Senate Bill 1096. The bill would require all nonparticipating manufacturers to either join the master settlement or be subject to modified escrow rules which prevent the companies from gaming the system to keep their escrow money. SB 1096 has supporters on both sides of the aisle, but it is not without its opponents. Small tobacco companies have been fighting different versions of the bill for more than a decade, calling it a tax on their products and a move on the part of big tobacco to earn more market share at their expense. SB 1096 has yet to pass either chamber of the General Assembly, and the consequences are already being felt. Because the bill failed to pass before April 15, Missouri can no longer receive the $50 million for 2016. In order to receive the money in 2017, the bill must be signed by Gov. Jay Nixon by June 3. Taxpayer impact The loophole is the source of Koster's $50 million figure, but will recouping the loss actually save taxpayers money? It certainly has cost the state. In October, Nixon withheld $46.1 million of the state's budget, relying on the passage of SB 1096 to fill the gap. Turner said that money would have gone to the Mental Health Department and the Department of Social Services, among others. For these programs to be maintained at their initial levels, Turner explained, taxpayers would be forced to cover the money lost in the tobacco arbitration. Gaining the $50 million dollars would allow those programs to remain uncut without costing the taxpayers any additional money. All things being equal, if the bill passes, taxpayers would win no matter what the state does with the money. If it's spent on services, citizens get the benefit of $50 million worth of services. If the state cuts spending and lowers taxes, they save money when they file their taxes in April. And that's just in 2017. If the loophole isn't closed, Missouri could lose additional money in the years to come. The big tobacco companies have begun arbitration concerning Missouri's diligent enforcement of the escrow laws in 2004. If an arbitration panel were to find against Missouri again, the state could be forced to forfeit more money. If SB 1096 passes, the companies would not seek arbitration for any of the years 2004 to 2014, per Koster's agreement.",,,,"'Closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000'",supported,true,,politifact

We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It's important to note this was not a statement of Obama's preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.

National Rifle Association Advocacy group https://home.nra.org/joint-statement a press release Thursday, October 5, 2017 2017-10-05 Read More info","In a rare move, the National Rifle Association issued a statement calling for regulation of the device that turned the Las Vegas shooter's rifles more deadly, blaming Barack Obama's administration for its approval. 'Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,' the NRA wrote in a statement. 'The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.' A bump or fire stock is a device that allows rifles to fire bullets as quickly as a machine gun. At least 12 of the Las Vegas shooter's guns were outfitted with them. But did Obama approve their legality? Sort of, but approved is probably the wrong word. NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter pointed us to a June 2010 approval letter from ATF, an agency under executive purview, sent to Slide Fire, a bump stock manufacturer. Spelling out the legal definition of a firearm, ATF's technology chief John Spencer determined it was not regulated by law. 'The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed,' Spencer wrote. 'Accordingly, we find that the 'bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.' Bump stocks harness a weapon's recoil to cause the user's finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don't alter the gun's internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful. We found a similar 2012 letter addressed to Bump Fire, a competing manufacturer. But just as these bump stocks didn't qualify for regulation, two similar devices did. The difference? The Akins Accelerator and the Autoglove were determined in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to have mechanical parts that enhanced the trigger mechanism, making them by definition machineguns. 'Electrically-driven trigger devices are considered 'machineguns' because they are a 'combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,' ' ATF's letter to AutoGlove read. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted since the 1934 National Firearms Act, and 1986 regulations made it much harder for civilians to get an automatic weapon like a machine gun. Obama administration's role Experts in firearm policy were divided when we asked about the fairness of the NRA's characterization. Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in guns, said it was appropriate to characterize the move as an approval of its sale under the Obama administration. 'Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,' Winkler said. Other legal experts stressed that it wasn't an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn't allow for its regulation. 'The statement implies Obama or (U.S. Attorney General Eric) Holder was somehow involved, and that it was an issue that wouldn't have been approved in any other administration, and that's technically incorrect,' said Rick Vasquez, a former Firearms Technology Branch official who first signed off on the recommendation the ATF could not regulate the Slide Fire. 'We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve (the Slide Fire),' Vasquez said. Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns. 'I believe (the NRA) were stating that just to point out that this wasn't some rogue decision made during a Republican administration, which would be more friendly to gun owners, and therefore that when they re-evaluate it, they're going to have to take a really close look at the law,' said John Pierce, a lawyer and advocate for gun rights. In order to re-evaluate the bump stock, Vasquez said the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated.",,,,'The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.,supported,mostly-true,,politifact

And many experts see the group's assertion that she signed an opinion 'saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms' as fair. We heard lots of agreement from experts about this characterization, though two advocates of gun control said it is over-simplified. Gun-control supporters in particular told us the opinion she signed is not as 'anti-gun' as the mailer would have readers believe. What's missing from this attack is the context that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before she signed the opinion in McDonald. That context slightly dulls the connection between Nelson and Sotomayor's position. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.","The National Rifle Association wants Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson out of office. A flier mailed to some Floridians by the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action compares Nelson's record on gun control with that of his Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV. One of its points: 'Bill Nelson voted to confirm Barack Obama's anti-gun nominees to the Supreme Court -- including Sonia Sotomayor who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.' For this fact-check, we wanted to confirm whether Nelson voted for Sotomayor and if she signed an opinion that said 'Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.' The first part is easy for us: Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor, Obama's first Supreme Court nominee and the country's first Hispanic justice, on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote. The second part -- that she signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms -- is a little harder to understand (at least, for those of us not trained in legalese). An NRA spokesman refused to elaborate on the ad's claim for PolitiFact Florida, including which opinion is even at issue here. Still, given her short tenure and the scarcity of possible gun rulings, it didn't take long to figure out. McDonald vs. Chicago It may not say it, but the ad is a reference to the 2010 Supreme Court case McDonald vs. Chicago, which dealt with handgun bans in Chicago and the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. It picked up where a landmark (pre-Sotomayor) Supreme Court decision left off. In 2008, the court ruled in District of Columbia vs. Heller that the Second Amendment includes an individual right of gun ownership, overturning a D.C. ban on handguns. Heller dealt with federal law and left undetermined whether this interpretation of the Second Amendment applied to state and local government restrictions on guns. In McDonald, the court had to decide whether to 'incorporate' the Second Amendment against the states. (Since the Civil War, the court has 'incorporated,' or extended, amendments within the Bill of Rights against state and local governments under the due process and equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment.) By a 5-4 majority, the court argued in McDonald that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own a gun against the regulations of state and local governments. The New York Times called the case 'an enormous symbolic victory for gun rights.' This wasn't the ruling Sotomayor wanted. She signed a 31-page dissenting opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer and co-signed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both Bill Clinton appointees. Breyer's opinion argued that using guns for self-defense did not warrant federal constitutional protection. The Heller decision, Breyer wrote, was grounded in an ambiguous historical record that did not substantiate a private self-defense right against the states. The Second Amendment was enacted to protect militia-related rights, he said, and decisions on gun control should be determined by local governments and legislatures. Many news accounts of the ruling honed in on this line from the conclusion: 'In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense.' That mirrors the NRA's claim about Sotomayor, said many experts we consulted. 'This is an easy one,' said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. 'The characterization of her opinion is accurate,' said David Kopel, research director of the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct constitutional law professor at Denver University. 'She joined an opinion that said Heller should be overruled.' Advocates of gun control saw more nuance. 'It was certainly not anti-gun,' said Daniel Vice, senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. 'The dissenting opinion did not pick a side in the gun debate.' At issue was the more technical question about incorporating private armed self-defense as a 'fundamental' right, he said. Was the right to keep a gun at home as central to U.S. citizenship as voting, freedom of speech and freedom religion that it deserved protection under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment? 'That's a different question than the question of whether the right exists or not,' said Brian Van Houten, Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence managing attorney. '(The NRA) presented a very dramatic claim about Justice Sotomayor's opinion in McDonald, but it doesn't match the reality of what was said there.' Others urged us to consider the alternative. If the opinion of Breyer and Sotomayor prevailed, states would have a lot more freedom to regulate gun ownership. 'Effectively, (the NRA) may be correct in the sense that had the court ruled that the Second Amendment was not incorporated, it would have left the states free to legislate in any way they choose,' said William Vizzard, California State University Sacramento criminal justice professor. We should expect litigation out of McDonald for years to come, he said. The important note to all of this, of course, is that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before her vote in McDonald.

Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas. Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems don't show quite the same drop in usage. But the statewide trend is clear. We rate the statement True.","The bad news regarding water in Georgia is legion. No major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought to insulate metro Atlanta from future water shortages. Water/sewer rates have gone up in several counties to cover everything from federally mandated upgrades to increased material costs. Then there is the so-called 'water war' with Alabama and Florida, a multi-year battle of lawsuits over how to meet the water needs across the states. So it was a surprise to read the recent headline in the Athens Banner-Herald: 'Water use in Georgia declines, even as population grows.' The trend, the May 10, 2015 story said, was a 30 percent drop in water usage in the three decades between 1980 and 2010, the last year that federal data was available. Suffice it to say the claim whet our appetite - we save wetting our whistle for after-hours - for the numbers and what might be going on. We reached out to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has a mandate to file a water usage report for the nation every five years. In concert with that work, the agency encourages states to conduct their own reports. Georgia has compiled a report every five years since 1975, in a bid to provide information about the precious resource in a state without a single natural lake. The 1980 report shows that year, Georgia sucked 6.7 billion gallons of water from Georgia rivers and aquifers every day. In 2010, it sipped 4.7 billion gallons every day. While the reports in that overall span show some increases - including a 21 percent jump in daily use during the 1990s - water usage has plunged 30 percent when looking at the three decades. Census figures show the number of people living in Georgia over that period exploded, from 5.46 million in 1980 to 9.69 million in 2010. That's a 77 percent increase. Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible? Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment. But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated. Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 - during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta. Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said. 'Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share,' Lawrence said. Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend. Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said. Those totals include a person's share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity. It's unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed. But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said. 'That's a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing,' Lawrence said. Local water providers, however, don't always follow the statewide trend. The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide. In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide. In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county. That's a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend. However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts. The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage. 'You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008,' county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said.",,,,"Between 1980 and 2010, water usage in Georgia dropped even as the state's population grew.",supported,true,,politifact

28297,100210,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/feb/20/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-republican-budget-proposals-dont-/, ,0,0,,,"Making the rounds reacting to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked why Republicans didn't 'cut their way to solvency' during the Bush administration in the 1990s. Johnson, a deficit hawk elected in 2010, reacted to the word 'cut.' 'Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We're trying to reduce the rate of growth in government,' he said Feb. 13, 2013, on public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7) in Milwaukee. 'And that's what we need to do. The fact of the matter is, the extreme position is to do nothing on either Social Security or Medicare, because those programs are going broke.' The bitter partisan warfare over who is cutting what and by how much can obscure the true nature of various deficit-relief plans. So let's test Johnson's claim that 'nobody in total is proposing cutting anything.' Rather, he claims, officials are 'trying to reduce the rate of growth in government.' In the case of Johnson, we've been down this road before, but with the shoe on the other foot. In defeating liberal Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, it was Johnson who portrayed limits on spending growth in Medicare -- supported by Feingold in the federal health care law -- as 'cuts' that would harm seniors. Now it's Johnson who complains that critics misconstrue caps on the rate of spending growth as 'cuts.' Such is politics. But let's look at the core issue raised by Johnson's comments. In Johnson's two years, have he and fellow Republicans advocated limits on federal spending growth -- or have they actually tried to shrink the budget from its current size? Over the next decade, looking at federal spending as a whole, it's clear that the intent is to slow the growth rate. You can see that in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposals, in the sequester set to take effect in March 2013 and in various spending-cap proposals pushed by Republican lawmakers. To be sure, the measures propose significant and often controversial reductions in spending over multiple years compared with current rates of growth, but they do not shrink the budget below current spending over the course of a decade. A few Johnson-specific examples: He supported both Ryan budgets. He signed onto the Contract from America plan to put a per-capita inflation cap on spending growth. He backed a spending-cap proposal by U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that tied spending to economic growth. And Johnson's comments in various forums, most recently in January, make clear he endorses limits on total growth. In the Ryan budgets, it's notable that in the first year of the 10-year projections, his blueprints called for spending less in year one than the year before. Federal budget plans typically are framed in 10-year increments, though, and spending rises in every year but the first under his plans. So Johnson's point is not knocked down by this, but it's something to consider when evaluating his claim. It's also worth noting that Johnson praised the 2012 Ryan proposal but said it wasn't aggressive enough in limiting growth. When you look more narrowly at specific categories of spending, instead of the whole budget, Ryan's proposals did indeed make actual year-to-year cuts -- and over the long-term. Example: Ryan's fiscal year 2012 plan proposed a cut in Medicaid outlays for that year, and didn't get them back to the previous level until 2019. And Ryan's 2012 plan cut non-defense discretionary programs by 25 percent over 10 years. Johnson, for his part, has endorsed enormous cuts on an agency-by-agency basis -- and even talks of eliminating some agencies entirely. In a January 2013 interview with The Daily Caller, Johnson said he'd go across the board. 'I truly believe that any of these agencies could easily withstand a 10 or 20 percent across the board cut and still be able to perform their function,' he told reporter Alex Pappas. Pappas quoted Johnson saying 'an awful lot of these' agencies 'probably have a harmful effect on the economy anyways, so I don't necessarily want to maintain their function.' Johnson has also scoffed at the size of the looming cuts called for in the sequester, which supposedly was a poison pill so horrible that it would force lawmakers to compromise to avoid swallowing the automatic, across-the-board cuts. A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate said the sequester would cost the United States 750,000 jobs in 2013 alone. Johnson said the sequester's cuts over 10 years amount to 'barely a rounding error' in the giant federal budget. He spoke on WTMJ-AM (620) radio in Milwaukee on February 14, 2013, about the sequester, which totals more than $1 trillion over a decade. So it's clear Johnson supports steep budget cuts in some areas in order to slow the overall budget's growth curve. Our rating Johnson said: 'Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We're trying to reduce the rate of growth in government.' While Johnson supports deep cutbacks in some budget areas, he and fellow Republicans repeatedly have made clear that in Washington budget-speak -- which typically covers 10-year increments -- they are talking about limiting the size of future spending increases. Those growth limits likely would mean significant program changes and fewer federal employees. But the budget would still grow overall. We've examined similar claims. PolitiFact National debunked Democrats' claims in 2011 that Ryan's budget would 'end' Medicare. And it declared Mostly False claims in 2010 by Republicans that the federal health care law cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare at the elderly's expense. Both ratings rested in part on the recognition that Medicare's budget would continue to grow, just at a slower pace, under the cost-savings plans. Johnson's claim is something of a reverse image of those claims, though on a grander scale. With the points of clarification noted above, we think his main point is on target. We rate his statement Mostly True. Featured Fact-check Kevin McCarthy stated on November 18, 2021 in a House floor speech 'Never in American history has so much been spent at one time. Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending.' By Louis Jacobson • November 19, 2021","Making the rounds reacting to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked why Republicans didn't 'cut their way to solvency' during the Bush administration in the 1990s. Johnson, a deficit hawk elected in 2010, reacted to the word 'cut.' 'Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We're trying to reduce the rate of growth in government,' he said Feb. 13, 2013, on public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7) in Milwaukee. 'And that's what we need to do. The fact of the matter is, the extreme position is to do nothing on either Social Security or Medicare, because those programs are going broke.' The bitter partisan warfare over who is cutting what and by how much can obscure the true nature of various deficit-relief plans. So let's test Johnson's claim that 'nobody in total is proposing cutting anything.' Rather, he claims, officials are 'trying to reduce the rate of growth in government.' In the case of Johnson, we've been down this road before, but with the shoe on the other foot. In defeating liberal Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, it was Johnson who portrayed limits on spending growth in Medicare -- supported by Feingold in the federal health care law -- as 'cuts' that would harm seniors. Now it's Johnson who complains that critics misconstrue caps on the rate of spending growth as 'cuts.' Such is politics. But let's look at the core issue raised by Johnson's comments. In Johnson's two years, have he and fellow Republicans advocated limits on federal spending growth -- or have they actually tried to shrink the budget from its current size? Over the next decade, looking at federal spending as a whole, it's clear that the intent is to slow the growth rate. You can see that in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposals, in the sequester set to take effect in March 2013 and in various spending-cap proposals pushed by Republican lawmakers. To be sure, the measures propose significant and often controversial reductions in spending over multiple years compared with current rates of growth, but they do not shrink the budget below current spending over the course of a decade. A few Johnson-specific examples: He supported both Ryan budgets. He signed onto the Contract from America plan to put a per-capita inflation cap on spending growth. He backed a spending-cap proposal by U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that tied spending to economic growth. And Johnson's comments in various forums, most recently in January, make clear he endorses limits on total growth. In the Ryan budgets, it's notable that in the first year of the 10-year projections, his blueprints called for spending less in year one than the year before. Federal budget plans typically are framed in 10-year increments, though, and spending rises in every year but the first under his plans. So Johnson's point is not knocked down by this, but it's something to consider when evaluating his claim. It's also worth noting that Johnson praised the 2012 Ryan proposal but said it wasn't aggressive enough in limiting growth. When you look more narrowly at specific categories of spending, instead of the whole budget, Ryan's proposals did indeed make actual year-to-year cuts -- and over the long-term. Example: Ryan's fiscal year 2012 plan proposed a cut in Medicaid outlays for that year, and didn't get them back to the previous level until 2019. And Ryan's 2012 plan cut non-defense discretionary programs by 25 percent over 10 years. Johnson, for his part, has endorsed enormous cuts on an agency-by-agency basis -- and even talks of eliminating some agencies entirely. In a January 2013 interview with The Daily Caller, Johnson said he'd go across the board. 'I truly believe that any of these agencies could easily withstand a 10 or 20 percent across the board cut and still be able to perform their function,' he told reporter Alex Pappas. Pappas quoted Johnson saying 'an awful lot of these' agencies 'probably have a harmful effect on the economy anyways, so I don't necessarily want to maintain their function.' Johnson has also scoffed at the size of the looming cuts called for in the sequester, which supposedly was a poison pill so horrible that it would force lawmakers to compromise to avoid swallowing the automatic, across-the-board cuts. A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate said the sequester would cost the United States 750,000 jobs in 2013 alone. Johnson said the sequester's cuts over 10 years amount to 'barely a rounding error' in the giant federal budget. He spoke on WTMJ-AM (620) radio in Milwaukee on February 14, 2013, about the sequester, which totals more than $1 trillion over a decade. So it's clear Johnson supports steep budget cuts in some areas in order to slow the overall budget's growth curve. Our rating Johnson said: 'Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything.

14473,1550,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/steelers-villanueva-police-brutality-protest/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In late September 2017, various right-wing web sites claimed Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin had 'ripped' one of his players, offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva, during a post-game press conference: While Tomlin and the rest of the team stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before playing the Chicago Bears that day, Villanueva - a United States Army veteran who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan - stood outside the tunnel leading onto the field at Soldier Field in Chicago. During his press conference after the Steelers' loss, Tomlin said that his players decided not to appear for the anthem after discussing whether the team would respond to insults thrown at both the National Football League and former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick by United States President Donald Trump. Trump had said that NFL owners should respond to Kaepernick and other players protesting extrajudicial killings on the part of police by saying, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he's fired. He's fired.' Tomlin said that it was the team's decision, not his, to not appear on the field during the national anthem: Like most teams in the National Football League we didn't ask for this. This was placed upon us by circumstance. I heard rumblings of guys talking during the course of the day yesterday. My contention was that we would not allow politics to divide us. We're football players. We're a football team. If any of them felt like something needed to be done I asked those guys to discuss it. And whatever they discussed, that we have 100 percent participation or we do nothing. They discussed it for an appropriate length of time. They couldn't come to an understanding, so they chose to remove themselves from it. They were not going to be disrespectful in the anthem. So they chose not to participate, but at the same time, many of them were not going to accept the words of the president. So we decided to sit it out, to not take the field. To remove ourselves from it, to focus on playing football. So those were our intentions. When a reporter pointed out that Villanueva was out of the tunnel during the anthem, Tomlin said: Like I said, I was looking for 100 percent participation. We were gonna be respectful of our football team. Man, these are divisive times in the United States, and it's a shame but it is. But we're not politicians. We're coaches and professional athletes. If those of us individuals choose to, you know, choose to participate in politics in some way I'm supportive of that. But when we come out of locker rooms, man, we come out of locker rooms to play football games. And to be quite honest with you, man, I didn't appreciate our football team being drug [sic] into politics this weekend. And I'm sure that that's a global perspective. But we're blessed to do this for a living and so with that blessing comes responsibility. We understand that. We understand that we're given a platform that's a unique one. Many of us are called to maybe do things that we wouldn't usually do because of that platform, where people apply pressure to us to do things because of that platform. And the bottom line is, we chose not to play ball today in that regard. Maybe we will. But today we just said 'no.' The statement did not criticize or condemn Villanueva's actions, contrary to claims reported online. Photographs of Villanueva showed other team members standing in the tunnel behind him. On 25 September 2017, Villanueva said that he asked one of the team's captains, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, if he could watch the anthem from the tunnel rather than remaining in the locker room: He agreed, and said the captains would be right out there behind me. So this plan sort of morphed to accommodate this tough moral dilemma that I had on my hands to where the players could be behind me in the tunnel. Ben Roethlisberger said, 'At [12]:56 make sure you're out there 'cause the national anthem's gonna start at 12:57. I walked out at 12:56, I asked one of the security guards when the national anthem was gonna start. He said, 'Twenty seconds.' So I just walked out and stopped as soon as I saw the flag. As soon as I saw a vantage point, that to me was enough. There was a flag that was coming in from one of the previous celebrations and when I turned around to sort of, you know, signal everybody else to come in so that they wouldn't leave me alone they were essentially unable to exit. So at that moment it was the decision of, do you walk out of the national anthem and join your teammates? I know that would've looked extremely bad - or as a team do you start moving halfway through the national anthem? Essentially what we can get out of this is that we butchered our plan to sort of have a response for the national anthem and respect everyone's opinions. According to Villanueva, he only told the team captains about his idea, meaning that his other teammates did not have an opportunity to join him outside the tunnel. That was the very embarrassing part on my end of what transpired: everybody sees an image of me standing by myself. Everybody thinks that the team, the Steelers, are not behind me. That's absolutely wrong; it's quite the opposite. He added: I made coach Tomlin look bad, and that is my fault and my fault only. I made my teammates look bad, and that is my fault and my fault only. I made a mistake. In a separate press conference on 26 September 2017, Tomlin expressed solidarity with Villanueva: I don't know why Villanueva was apologizing. He had nothing to apologize for. I guess he just feels like he brought this upon us, and that's a shame. Kaepernick originated the protests prior to the 2016 regular season, originally sitting on the bench during the anthem. Former Seattle Seahawks player Nate Boyer - a veteran of the U.S. Army Special Forces -said in September 2016 that after discussing the issue with the quarterback, Kaepernick agreed to carry out his silent demonstration by kneeling: We sorta came to a middle ground where he would take a knee alongside his teammate. Soldiers take a knee in front of a fallen brother's grave, you know, to show respect. When we're on a patrol, you know, and we go into a security halt, we take a knee, and we pull security. We have contacted the Steelers seeking further comment.",Did Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin 'Rip' Alejandro Villanueva For Not Protesting During the National Anthem?

Here's an example of a query, posted to Twitter, with the user's name cropped out for privacy. The letter, dated April 2, 2020, is indeed real and was posted to WhiteHouse.gov. Signed by Trump, the letter is an expression of the acrimony between Trump and legislators from New York, a state that has been ravaged by the deadly COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Trump and the Democratic leadership of that state had been trading accusations, with political leaders of the Empire State accusing the Trump administration of failing to mount an adequate federal response and provide desperately needed medical equipment as the death toll rises. Trump's letter to Schumer appeared to blame the shortage of supplies, like diagnostic tests, protective gear for medical workers, and ventilators, on impeachment proceedings against Trump. He was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2019 and acquitted by the Senate in early February 2020. The letter reads, in part: If you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers), and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the 'invisible enemy.' No wonder AOC [U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and others are thinking about running against you in the primary. If they did, they would likely win. Trump's letter was in response to a letter that Schumer sent him the same day. Schumer's letter urged Trump to use the full authority of the so-called Defense Protection Act to close the gap in equipment shortfalls as the virus swept across the country and to prevent states from being forced to bid against each other in order to acquire medical supplies and protective equipment. The letter also implored Trump to designate a senior military official to oversee production of supplies and accused the Trump administration of 'tardiness and inadequacy' in its response. As of this writing, the state of New York has more than 100,000 COVID-19 cases, with 2,935 deaths. The United States has a total of 258,611 cases, with 6,660 deaths.",Is This a Real Letter from Trump to US Sen. Chuck Schumer?

More often than not, the funds that go toward research in the form of scientific and technological grants (and particularly odd-sounding grants) usually get labeled as wasteful spending. (Does anybody remember the great ant debate?) Well, we're on the case of another wasteful-spending accusation; this time radio personality Lars Larson is accusing TriMet of a particularly poor investment choice. On Dec. 21, 2010, he sent out a mighty tweet proclaiming: '(T)he brain trust at Tri Met just announced they are spending 4.2 million in fed funds to save $168K per year.' To add a little insult to injury he also asked a question: '(C)an anyone down there do math?' By our calculation, anyway, an investment of $4.2 million being paid back at $168,000 a year wouldn't be cleared for some 25 years. That's a ways off, to be sure, so we figured it was worth looking into whether TriMet was investing wisely 'in these hard economic times.' First off, we needed a little context. What, exactly was this $4.2 million going to fund? We gave TriMet a call and Bekki Witt, the agency's spokeswoman, e-mailed us a release. Here's how it starts out and where Larson gets his $4.2 million figure: 'TriMet has received a $4.2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to expand the use of regenerative braking on MAX trains. The grant will allow TriMet to install 20 energy storage units on light rail vehicles, capturing much of the energy generated by the trains' braking systems and storing that energy for immediate and future use.' Sounds good. Now how about that $168,000 annual savings? Just read a little further: 'The new units will release the stored energy to help power those trains as well as other trains on the system. The storage units, or energy capacitors, will capture and use nearly 100 percent of the power generated by braking trains, saving $168,000 a year in energy costs.' Based on those two paragraphs, it seems Larson is on to something. TriMet is spending more than $4 million to upgrade its regenerative braking systems so that they can store the saved energy. That energy adds up to a savings of about $168,000 annually. But, as with most research, sometimes dollars are just the beginning when it comes to the returns. So, we gave Witt a call and asked her what she thought about Larson's comments. The figures sound, right, we said. What gives? First, she said, it's important to understand the scope of the grant program from which TriMet received the funds. According to the FTA website, the program was created when 'The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus) provided $100 million to be distributed as discretionary grants to public transit agencies for capital investments that will assist in reducing the energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions of public transportation systems.' Witt elaborated: 'TriMet is the first in the country to try this technology out. ... We're kind of part of that research and development aspect of it.' As it stands now, TriMet does recoup some of the energy the trains create while braking, but that energy must be used almost immediately, either by the train itself or by a nearby train (the rescued energy can be transferred short distances). With this new technology, that saved energy can be stored and used for broader purposes, she said. 'It gives us that flexibility that we don't have right now,' Witt said. 'This is something we see as a valuable project that will pay off in the long term. it's kind of a pilot, if you will, to see how it might work for us and for other transit programs throughout the country.' When we contacted the Federal Transit Administration, the director and an engineer there echoed Witt's remarks. 'In time, we're confident this regenerative braking will reduce transportation costs significantly around the country - while also reducing our dependence on oil,' wrote administrator Peter Rogoff in an e-mail comment. We wondered if any of this might convince Larson that the trade-off was not as stark as he initially believed. No, he said, it didn't.

Larson is looking at this grant in the Portland vacuum. TriMet and the Federal Transit Administration are looking at it in a broader, national context: TriMet is spending $4.2 million to refine technology that might, eventually, offer a significant return. So what about the ruling? Well, it would be premature to offer up a figure for the return on research, just as Larson argued. That said, he certainly simplified the grant and the expenditure.

17268,4837,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-closed-airports-july4/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 3 July 2017, the web site ATC Memes published an article reporting that President Donald Trump had grounded all flights in the United States in honor of Independence Day: Calling it a 'monumental achievement for both patriotism and transportation', President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the entire National Airspace System of the United States would be closed to all flights on Independence Day. Amidst hostility already brewing from a week of controversial Twitter posts, Donald Trump took to a more conservative approach to announce the news: an e-mail to airline executives. 'In an effort to increase the public's awareness of the Fourth of July Independence Day holiday, and in an effort to boost an industry I deem to be unfake [sic], all commercial aircraft to, from, and within the United States are to be grounded on Tuesday,' the e-mail stated. It went onto mention other rather curious topics: a brief history of American innovation in aviation, the benefits of a more isolated approach to globalism, favorite foods of the president, and finally, why he would have mentioned all of this on Twitter, but his advisors told him not to, and in fact later changed his password. After a 7-paragraph regression analysis on why password requirements are unnecessary, the e-mail then seems to collectively wish people a happy 4th of July, before trailing off in a strange tirade about CNN.

5888,3422,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/thr-nazis-1937/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In the midst of a September 2017 debate over whether the propriety of NFL players' engaging in protests during the playing of the U.S. national anthem, a book excerpt was circulated online that brought to light the movie industry's attempt to downplay criticism against Nazi Germany in the 1930s: The excerpt featured a quote attributed to Frank Pope, who was then the managing editor of the entertainment industry trade publication The Hollywood Reporter (THR), from a column he wrote in 1937 chiding film stars for speaking out on political issues: 'The Hollywood stars who are so earnest - and so public - in their sympathies for anti-Nazism, anti-fascism and other antis, are doing more harm to themselves than good to the causes they sponsor,' insisted columnist Frank Pope in the Hollywood Reporter. 'How long will it be before the unpopularity which they certainly will gather, in some countries, will begin to affect their screen standing and, later perhaps, their salaries?' Both the quote and the excerpt were taken from a real book, Thomas Patrick Doherty's Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939, published in 2013. Doherty and THR both sent us pictures of Pope's column as it was originally printed on the front page of the Reporter on on 16 October 1937: Doherty, a professor of American Studies at Brandeis University, told us that Pope's viewpoint represented the 'mainstream opinion' of Hollywood distributors and film moguls at the time, as the movie industry was leery of portraying Nazis in a negative light to avoid alienating what was then the second-largest film market in the world. However, Doherty said, opposition to the Nazis from within the film industry led to the formation of what was called the 'popular front,' a loose alliance of actors and screenwriters who engaged in off-screen activism. The increased political activity among this group led to the formation of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936: This was a group that wanted to raise American consciousness about Nazism and they incorporated a lot of Hollywood stars and screenwriters and directors to get publicity for their cause. The segment that was going around on the Twittersphere was about how the studio moguls who looked upon, especially, their stars as their own private property that they had nurtured and developed were leery of having the stars use their star charisma for a political cause. Because at the time, the thinking was, 'If you want to send a message, use Western Union.' And they looked upon the stars as their kind-of private property. Doherty also noted that any type of activism in the film industry was 'really new' for the time and carried a particular political risk for studios because of the restrictions set forth by what was popularly known as the Hays Code: This was at a time when the government could censor movies. Film had no First Amendment rights. Any time the film industry kind of pressed against the government, there was always the fear that the government would found a federal motion picture censorship bureau, which they could have done before 1952 when the Supreme Court gave film First Amendment rights. The high court extended those rights to the motion picture industry in its unanimous decision in Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, which stated: Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a state may not place a prior restraint on the showing of a motion picture film on the basis of a censor's conclusion that it is 'sacrilegious.' Doherty added that the Reporter was also a different kind of publication at the time Pope's column was published: They really just spoke to the industry in the 1930s. It was much more of an inside newsletter for the people in the motion picture business. They're really just talking to themselves without the sense that anybody's eavesdropping. Of course, today everybody gets The Hollywood Reporter online or checks the motion picture box office on Monday morning. It's really not a private conversation the way it was in the 1930s. Even though studios can not overtly dissuade actors from taking political stances, he said, discussions of the potential impact on them for doing so continue: I don't think anyone would say that George Clooney shouldn't speak up for what he believes in. But there is a lot of talk even today in Hollywood about what effect that has on the box office. If you read the chatrooms both at Deadline Hollywood or The Hollywood Reporter it's kind of difficult to quantify the blowback that an actor extratextural activity will have on the text in the movies. For some actors I don't think it matters - Clint Eastwood, I don't think liberals go to his movies but he's such an icon. But there's a lot of talk about, say, Clooney's movies maybe not scoring with the popular audience the way they used to because he's such an up-front liberal. I would imagine there's a lot of talk in executive boardrooms about this but they can't squash these stars the way they did in the 1930s because they're not under permanent contract to Warner Brothers or MGM. On 9 August 2013, THR published a lengthy excerpt from another book, The Collaboration: Hollywood's Pact with Hitler, chronicling not only the film industry's hands-off policy toward Nazis, but a Senate probe into allegations that Hollywood had reversed course after World War II had begun and promoted anti-Nazi themes in order to draw the U.S. into the conflict: The most dramatic moment came when the head of 20th Century Fox, Darryl F. Zanuck, gave a rousing defense of Hollywood: 'I look back and recall pictures so strong and powerful that they sold the American way of life, not only to America but to the entire world. They sold it so strongly that when dictators took over Italy and Germany, what did Hitler and his flunky, Mussolini, do? The first thing they did was to ban our pictures, throw us out. They wanted no part of the American way of life.' In the thunderous applause that followed, no one pointed out that Zanuck's own studio had been doing business with the Nazis just the previous year.",Did the Hollywood Reporter Criticize Actors Who Opposed Nazi Germany in 1937? The newspaper's managing editor chided stars who he said were courting 'unpopularity' by speaking out against Hitler's regime.

By Andy Nguyen • November 29, 2021 The use of statistics dominated a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives on April 27, 2011. The bills, which passed the House and are being heard in the Senate, include a broader ban on third-term abortions, tighter requirements for notifying parents when a minor seeks an abortion, and a mandate that women be offered an opportunity to view and hear a description of ultrasound images before receiving an abortion. Another bill seeks to amend the state Constitution to prevent possible state funding of most abortion procedures. Among all the stats used in nearly six hours of floor speeches, one stood out. It came from Republican Rep. Richard Corcoran of New Port Richey and caught the attention of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates on Twitter. The group posted a message that said Corcoran claimed that '90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted.' 'PolitiFact anyone?' the group asked. We heard it, too, and spoke with Corcoran after the House adjourned. He said he found it in a couple of different places, including in a New York Times story. Corcoran's point was that we, as Americans, have to do more to try to prevent abortion. But is he right about the high percentage of abortion in these cases? Sure enough, we found the Times article Corcoran was referencing. The article from 2007 discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that 'about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion.' The line was not sourced, meaning the story did not say specifically where it came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion. We searched and found other studies that show similar percentages. A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here). We asked the Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health, if we should be aware of any other data. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said she didn't know of anything else. That leaves us to rely on these studies, which have been cited by subsequent researchers.

36269,119334,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/jul/29/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-us-leads-world-climate-doubt/, ,0,0,,,We rate Limbaugh's claim Mostly True.,"After a 26-year crusade against 'environmentalist wackos,' Rush Limbaugh has emerged triumphant, according to the conservative radio host himself. Citing recent findings by market researchers Ipsos MORI, Limbaugh said on his July 22, 2014, radio show that the United States leads the pack in questioning climate change, and he's taking all the credit. 'Fifty-four percent of Americans agreed with the statement, 'The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity,' ' he said. 'Why would the U.S. be the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change? Why do you think that would be? I think that's exactly right: Me. There's just no other explanation' Whether Limbaugh is giving praise where praise is due, we can't know for sure. But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism. Global lukewarming We'll start with Limbaugh's source. In its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.) Respondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change. The countries were then ranked by the percentage who agreed with the statement. Here's how the U.S. fared: Based on the results, the United States had the lowest percentage of people say that climate change is: 1. Largely man-made, and 2. Leading the world toward environmental ruin. The United States also tied India for the highest percentage of people agree that climate change is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time, though more Americans disagreed with the statement than Indians. All of that gives Limbaugh's claim credence, though there are a couple of caveats. Ipsos MORI research director Bobby Duffy said Limbaugh's conclusion that the United States is the most skeptical country is 'probably too simple.' While the numbers indicate that the United States is the least likely nation among those surveyed to see climate change as a man-made issue, the majority of Americans -- albeit, not by a huge margin -- still believe that climate change is anthropogenic. Moreover, Americans aren't scoffing at the general idea of climate change. The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization. Hockey stick gaffes The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher. Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in 'developed' (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a 'more affluent and 'connected' population' to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy. To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn't make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull. 'If you're looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it's apples to oranges,' he said. Still, Ipsos' findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it's mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.) One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup's 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008. That's slightly below the world's average but far below the rates in developed countries. Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it's politics that is causing the skepticism. The ruling Limbaugh said that the United States is 'the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.' While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn't capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors.

Among them are retirees, a powerful voting bloc, which means Democrats who pushed for the reform have some explaining to do. How do they convince them that they have their best interests in mind? Enter Georgia's Democratic Party, whose chair Jane Kidd wrote a column to address these concerns. That opinion piece was e-mailed to the press. Thanks to health care reform, the op-ed said, seniors will get free services that can help keep them healthy. She wrote: 'For example, while seniors today must pay for preventative care, health reform eliminates co-pays, deductibles, and other costs for preventative care and provides for free annual wellness checkups starting next year - ensuring that every Georgia senior has the care they need to better maintain their health.' Free? Is this too good to be true? To back up their claim, Georgia's Democrats referred us to an article in The Record newspaper of Troy, N.Y., that cited the AARP. It states that 'many preventative services . . . will now be free for Medicare beneficiaries, and they won't have to shell out co-pays for those services.' They also sent an article from CNN.com that said, 'Medicare will provide free annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011,' and a fact sheet from WhiteHouse.gov that said the same thing. We called the AARP, a group known for its extensive research on issues that affect seniors. They confirmed that seniors who have Medicare will receive annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011. These benefits were established by Title IV of the massive health care overhaul bill, dubbed 'Prevention of Chronic Disease and Improving Public Health.' By 2010, Medicare recipients will receive free 'annual wellness visits' from their health care providers. The checkup will include the creation of a personal prevention plan and a schedule of recommended health screenings for the next five to 10 years, the bill states. Since the AARP took sides on the issue, we sought additional verification. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that administers these programs, confirmed the AARP account and gave some additional information. There is some question about whether members of Medicare Advantage plans -- the privately managed plans that operate under the Medicare umbrella -- will also receive these wellness visits for free. A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said federal law requires that Medicare Advantage plans provide, at a minimum, the services included in Medicare. So by 2011, these plans will also have to provide wellness visits without charge. Generally speaking, the health care law has several provisions that attempt to change Medicare so that it pays for good outcomes instead of paying per procedure, a system known as 'fee for service.' The free preventive care is part of that overall philosophy. Tests such as cancer screenings that are already free under Medicare will remain so, and additional tests may also be included, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. Still, we at PolitiFact Georgia remained dubious. Is there no provision that will make seniors pay for the 'free' preventive services in an indirect way? Well there's free. And then there's 'free.' It's free if you paid your Medicare taxes, and make below a certain income. Over time, higher-income seniors will find that their overall Medicare costs increase, according to tax expert Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank with conservative roots, and a PolitiFact Georgia review of the legislation. Under the current system, recipients with individual incomes of $85,000 or family incomes of $170,000 pay higher premiums to receive coverage. Under the new system, the pool of people who pay this bigger bill will gradually increase because the income thresholds will not be adjusted for inflation until 2019,according to Section 3402 of the legislation. For those who cross the threshold, this could mean an increase of roughly $50 a month, Antos said. All taxpayers, including seniors, who make more than $200,000 individually or $250,000 as a family will pay more in payroll taxes under Section 9015 of the bill. Also, seniors who like to work on their tans -- whoever you are -- should watch out. Indoor tanning salons will have to pay an excise tax under the new law. That cost will likely be passed on to customers, Gleckman said. But the overwhelming majority of retired seniors will find that free preventive services are just that. Free.

She cited a specific percentage of 31.5 percent and said it came from the 2013 fiscal year. It's actually from the 2015 fiscal year. But the percentage from 2013 is very close to that. Roberts may have gotten the source year wrong, but it turns out that either year produces the same result. We rate her statement as True. (If you have a claim you'd like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)","The Raimondo administration wants to see more efficiency when it comes to spending on Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that provides health insurance to the very poor and people with disabilities. Roughly every dollar spent by the state is matched by the federal government. During a March 2, 2015, presentation to the Reinventing Medicaid Working Group, the state's secretary for health and human services, Elizabeth Roberts, displayed a slide which said that nearly a third of all state tax dollars goes to Medicaid. 'More than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid,' the slide said. It also contained a pie chart in which Medicaid is shown eating up 31.5 percent of those tax dollars. The slide lists the source as the state budget for the 2013 fiscal year. But on March 31, 2015, groups that want to create a single-payer health insurance system in the state challenged that statistic and others being used by the Raimondo administration in its push for Medicaid reform. The Rhode Island chapters of Physicians for a National Health Program and HealthCare Now said the actual percentage isn't 31.5 for fiscal 2013, but closer to 22. We decided to see who was correct. Because Roberts specifically mentioned 'state tax dollars,' for this fact check, we will only look at general revenue funds raised by the state, not federal funds shared with the state or restricted funds. When we contacted Roberts' office, spokesman Michael Raia said the source of the information was listed incorrectly. The 31.5 percent is based on the current fiscal year of 2015. According to data from the House Finance committee, this year the state is slated to spend $1.084 billion of its unrestricted money on Medicaid. That's 31.5 percent of the $3.445 billion in general revenue funds. (The state budget enacted that year totaled $8.78 billion, including restricted revenue and federal money for Medicaid and other things.) That made us curious. What were the numbers in 2013, the year cited incorrectly by Roberts? The Rhode Island Health Care Association, one of the groups questioning the numbers, referred us to the executive summary of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's budget for the 2015 fiscal year. Page A-5 listed $3.216 billion in general revenue for that year and page 71 of the budget's technical appendix says the Office of Health and Human Services (OHHS) actually received $772 million from the general fund. That would be 24 percent, close to what the critics claimed. But in the 2013 enacted budget, 20 percent of the state's Medicaid money was spent by other departments, including Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) and the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). That makes the 24 percent too low. When all of the state's spending for Medicaid out of its general revenues is accounted for, the percentage comes out to around 31 percent.",,,,'More than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid.,supported,true,,politifact

He promoted them in Portland during his time as a city council member, then ended his term early to go help other cities start their own. Hales hasn't advocated expanding the city's system during his current campaign, but the subject keeps coming up. During an appearance on Oregon Public Broadcasting's 'Think Out Loud,' Hales explained why he's so keen on street cars. It comes down to three things, he said: Because 'streetcars carry more people than buses. Because you attract more riders who don't ride transit now. And actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus. The trick is coming up with the very large capital cost.' These sorts of talking points get thrown around a lot by rail-system advocates. We thought it was high time we checked it out. Our first call was to Hales' campaign. His spokeswoman, Jessica Moskovitz, sent us a thorough e-mail outlining the support for the various pieces of the statement. Before we get to all that, though, let's start with TriMet when spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. On whether streetcars carry more people than buses, there is no ambiguity. Streetcars have a maximum capacity of 92 riders, according to Fetsch. That's nearly double the 51 or so riders who can fit on a single bus. (It was clear during the interview that Hales was talking capacity here and not the actual number of riders.) The next part was about whether streetcars have a smaller operating cost. Naturally, our minds went to the huge down payment a city has to make on tracks, whereas a bus can use existing roads. But Hales was careful to take that out of the equation by acknowledging the startup costs. It's clear he was talking about day-to-day operation. On that point, he seems to be right again. According to Fetsch, the streetcar operations cost $1.50 per boarding ride, while the bus costs $2.82. Now, there are a few important caveats here. Portland's streetcar system is much smaller than TriMet's bus and MAX systems. That's important because those two systems require a command center, which deals with dispatch and customer service. The streetcar also ducks security charges -- Portland police take care of the streetcar while TriMet has to budget for the Transit Police Division. You also have to consider the fact that the streetcar serves just the city core, while the MAX and bus systems operate in the low-density, outer areas and run both earlier and later. The last bit of important context here, too, is that the streetcar system requires fewer maintenance expenses: It's younger and it runs at lower speeds, so it has less wear than the MAX and bus system. That leaves us with the last bit: Do streetcars really attract riders who don't typically take public transit? Moskovitz, the spokeswoman for Hales, pointed us to a study by Edson Tennyson for the National Research Council on the issue of rail transit. Tennyson concluded that, all things being equal, 'rail transit is likely to attract 34 percent to 43 percent more riders than will equivalent bus services.' There was a catch, though: That paper was written more than two decades ago. The only other source Moskovitz had was an article touting the increase in streetcar ridership. TriMet, however, had two pieces of pertinent information. First up, between 2000 and 2003, bus stops within a sixth of a mile of the streetcar saw ridership drop by 20 percent when the rail went online. Meanwhile, the streetcar ridership grew well beyond that drop, indicating the system was attracting more people than just those who would have ridden the bus. Second, according to a June 2011 rider study, 38 percent of occasional and infrequent riders exclusively used the MAX, while only 12 percent exclusively used the bus. Of course, the MAX is not the streetcar, but this fact seems to speak to the attractiveness of rail travel over bus for some transit users. While the data are somewhat old and somewhat tangential, taken together they seem to support Hale's claim that the streetcar attracts more infrequent riders. So that brings us to the ruling. Hales said 'streetcars carry more people than buses ... you attract more riders who don't ride transit now, and actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus.' Whether these arguments make a persuasive case for the necessity and usefulness of a streetcar system is, of course, up for debate. The statement itself remains factual.

19293,7298,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-dead-and-cloned/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"While there's no doubt the 2016 election cycle has been one of the more unusual ones in recent history, perhaps the culmination of the parade of bizarre rumors about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is that she was killed off in 1998 and is now represented by one of her many clones. Rumors have abounded that Clinton's health is failing, alongside the idea that she has every disease from subcortical vascular dementia to Parkinson's. These claims were bolstered by footage of Clinton nearly collapsing while leaving a 11 September 2016 ceremony due to a pneumonia diagnosis, which also sparked a new round of death rumors. But on 15 September 2016, a blog called 'Ascension with Mother Earth and Current State of Affairs' took the weirdness to a whole new extreme by seemingly mashing all the rumors about Clinton into one giant conglomeration: Fact: Hillary Clinton has been dead since 1998. Another fact: The entire Clinton Family was eliminated and cloned beneath Camp David at the same time - including Chelsea (who's husband is her handler; Huma is Hillary's handler) Meaning, none of the current human replicas claiming to be true Clinton's have a soul, and none are in fact human. This is how and why they always lie in public sly no matter the social cost. They're soulless beings, performing daily tasks based on a common agenda set forth by their dark nobility handlers. Wow, that's a lot to digest, right? Let's go a little further down the rabbit hole shall we. Fact: What you have been watching all of years are human replicas or laboratory grown clones. They can be grown to full maturity in less than 3 days now, and their entire memories transferred-and even stored on computers-then downloaded into replacement clones. There are half dozen Bill and Hillary's that travel with the Clinton entourages and are on reserve 24/7/355 should the hero clone fail. Sadly, there none left for Hillary on Sunday, so a well trained body double was pressed into action first to walk out of Chelsea's apartment post fall, then today was made to do public appearances like on Hillary's campaign plane as well as that faux North Carolina press conference. For starters, there were no known instances of human cloning (let alone advanced cloning that could result in a fully-mature adult in three days), until 2008, when scientists successfully cloned a human embryo. To date, there are no known cloned humans to have grown past the very early stages of gestation: From a technical perspective, cloning humans and other primates is more difficult than in other mammals. One reason is that two proteins essential to cell division, known as spindle proteins, are located very close to the chromosomes in primate eggs. Consequently, removal of the egg's nucleus to make room for the donor nucleus also removes the spindle proteins, interfering with cell division. In other mammals, such as cats, rabbits and mice, the two spindle proteins are spread throughout the egg. So, removal of the egg's nucleus does not result in loss of spindle proteins. In addition, some dyes and the ultraviolet light used to remove the egg's nucleus can damage the primate cell and prevent it from growing. It's rather subjective to claim that clones wouldn't have 'souls' considering a clone would be, in effect, a distinct living organism and also the idea of a soul is more theological than scientific. The problematic distinction of who has a soul and who does not can be seen in the the late 6th Century European debate over whether or not women had souls. To additionally claim the entire Clinton family was wiped out or 'eliminated' in 1998 is of course beyond the pale, as Bill Clinton was the sitting U.S. President until 2001. Hillary Clinton has held high-profile political offices, both as a New York senator and Secretary of State, since 1998 as well. The family has been continuously in the public eye and there is no sign that anything so catastrophic happened to them. Moreover the claim that 'their entire memories transferred - and even stored on computers - then downloaded into replacement clones' seems to be plagiarized from science fiction. We couldn't find anything credible pointing to the existence of grown human clones, let alone a stockpile of Hillary replacement clones, nor could we find anything that indicates the entire Clinton family was wiped out while President Bill Clinton was still in office - and no one noticed.",Hillary Clinton Is Actually Dead and Has Been Cloned One of the stranger claims about the Democratic candidate for president is that she was 'eliminated' in 1998 and has since been replaced by a clone.

We rate this post Mostly False.","Dandelion root extract is purported to hold many health benefits, such as supplying antioxidants and reducing cholesterol. But a sweeping claim on social media about its effectiveness as a cancer remedy calls for a dose of skepticism. 'Did you know? Dandelion root is able to kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours,' an Instagram post reads. 'Not only that, but it acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory, immunity booster, antioxidant and organ detoxifier.' The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim about cancer cells appears to draw on real scientific studies of dandelion root extract as a natural aid in fighting cancer. But it leaves out important context about the nature of the research and its conclusions. This isn't the first time such a claim has circulated. In September 2016, Snopes rated 'mostly false' a headline on an article from the website Health Eternally, which referenced a testimonial from John Di Carlo, a 72-year-old man in Canada, who told the Canadian broadcaster CBC that he had gone into remission from leukemia after drinking dandelion tea. The Health Eternally article said 'studies have shown' the extract to kill cancer cells within 48 hours, but it didn't cite specific research. Health Eternally also referenced a 2012 CBC interview with Dr. Caroline Hamm, medical oncologist at the Windsor Cancer Research Group, in which she spoke about the promise of dandelion root extract. Hamm studied the extract's effects on cancer cells and published a case report about a patient who had used the root in a tea with favorable results. But she warned that the tea didn't work for everyone and that taking the extract could interfere with regular chemotherapy. Despite her warnings, false claims began circulating about the extract as a cancer fighter. In 2017, CBC reported that Hamm had received numerous emails and calls from cancer patients who believed that they should stop all medications and only use dandelion root extract. 'It's just very sad that people do this,' Hamm told CBC. 'It's really unfortunate for patients who believe it. It offers false hope.' The numbers in the Instagram post appear to align with findings of a November 2016 study by researchers at the University of Windsor in Ontario. They found that dandelion root extract 'induced program cell death (PCD) selectively in (more than) 95% of colon cancer cells ... by 48 hours of treatment.' The study was published in the journal Oncotarget. In an interview with USA Today, Siyaram Pandey, a chemistry and biochemistry professor who co-authored that study, pointed out that this finding was based on a study of cells in a petri dish, not cancer in the human body. A 2019 University of Windsor study published in an alternative-medicine journal from Hindawi found that both dandelion root and lemongrass extracts, when used with chemotherapy treatments, can help induce the death of prostate cancer cells in mice. This study, which also included Pandey as a co-author, warns that 'their efficacy on prostate cancer and their interactions with standard chemotherapeutics have not been studied to determine if they will be suitable for adjuvant therapies,' meaning follow-up treatment to prevent recurrence of the cancer. Pandey's LinkedIn profile and various other articles about his research identify him as chief scientific officer of a company called Windsor Botanical Therapeutics since 2014. Pandey told PolitiFact that Canadian regulators approved clinical trials of dandelion root extract for cancer patients as far back as 2013, but researchers had trouble recruiting subjects, and funding dried up.",,,,'Dandelion root is able to kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours.,refuted,barely-true,<p>Studies have examined how effective dandelion root extract is against cancer. </p>,politifact

'The former Governor of Massachusetts is taking yet another short cut to the Utah Senate Seat,' Nickie Titus, campaign manager for Democrat Jenny Wilson, said in a press release. 'Mitt certainly does things his way - moves to Utah from California (and) uses a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race.' It turns out Wilson's campaign is right: Romney is using $1 million from his failed presidential bid to fuel his Senate campaign. Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism. Campaign fund-shifting Romney's failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney's public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial - and flexible - bankroll. Campaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said. 'It happens all the time,' said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. 'House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it's okay.' Holman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn't mean it's fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that's contrary to donors' intentions. 'A donor may have supported Romney's presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney's new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election,' Holman said. 'Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors' funds without getting their approval.' Romney followed suit At the beginning of 2018, Romney for President, Inc., the nonprofit organization that supported Romney's failed 2012 presidential bid, had roughly $1.3 million cash on hand. On Feb. 5, the organization transferred $1 million to Romney for Utah, Inc., according to an FEC filing. To the chagrin of Romney's opponents, the transfer from Romney's presidential campaign to his Senate run comprises donations made mostly by non-Utah residents, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 'The $1 million is indicative of what we're seeing from Mitt Romney. He's bringing in national money to make this a national-profile race,' Wilson told the Tribune. 'I'm a Utahn running for Utahns.' The April 15, 2018, FEC filing, which covered the first three months of the year, shows the organization also made smaller disbursements for consulting work, email services and bank fees.

We fact-checked five and found them inaccurate. First, there is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. There is also no evidence that exposing your clothing to the sun will kill the coronavirus. Health officials recommend that people avoid touching their face and wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at a time - not every 20 minutes, as the message claims. There's also no evidence that consuming cold things makes you more susceptible to the virus. Finally, while the science is far from settled, there's no proof that the coronavirus can live for up to nine days on metallic surfaces. The best available evidence suggests that it can remain viable on stainless steel for up to three days. We rate the claims False. If you receive a chain message that you want us to fact-check, send a screenshot to [email protected] or forward it to us on Facebook.","A false post about COVID-19 is being shared in a new format on Facebook. In an audio message that a reader sent us on March 23, a woman with a British accent lists 10 ways that people can avoid being infected with the coronavirus. The message claims to be based on research from Chinese scientists. 'It was sent to me by a colleague who has a friend that works at Dr. Negrin, which is the main hospital on our island,' says the woman on the audio message. 'It's obviously in Spanish, so I'm just going to read it and translate it for you.' University Hospital of Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin is located in the city of Las Palmas on Gran Canaria, one of Spain's Canary Islands. The island chain's tourism industry has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's some of the questionable medical advice in the audio message that caught our eye: 'Take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes' Hang clothes 'in direct sunlight, which also neutralizes the virus' 'Wash your hands every 20 minutes' 'Try to avoid eating and drinking cold things' 'Wash metallic surfaces very carefully because the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days' If some of those claims sound familiar, it's because many of them have been circulating on social media in some form since January, when the World Health Organization addressed a slew of COVID-19 rumors on Twitter. We've also debunked several bogus coronavirus prevention and treatment methods. But this audio message was new to us, so we decided to check out each of the five claims. All of them either lack evidence or have been debunked by public health officials. 'Take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes' This is inaccurate - we rated a similar claim False. While health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. The primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth. So to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus. In a tweet published Feb. 7, the WHO said it does not advise people to drink water as a way to avoid coronavirus infection. Hang clothes 'in direct sunlight, which also neutralizes the virus' While air-drying your clothes may save you some money on your electricity bill, there is no evidence it will kill the coronavirus. We've rated similar claims False. There is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don't like heat. Influenza, for example, thrives in dry, cold weather, which is one reason the flu season typically spans from fall to spring. And high-intensity UV light can kill viruses. RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself But that doesn't mean sun exposure kills the coronavirus. Experts told us natural sunlight doesn't provide the UV intensity needed to kill the virus, and the WHO says on its website that COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, 'including areas with hot and humid weather.' Neither the WHO nor the CDC lists sunlight exposure as a method to kill the coronavirus. In fact, the WHO has debunked the claim, saying 'there is no evidence that sunlight kills the new coronavirus.' 'Wash your hands every 20 minutes' Public health officials say washing your hands is one of the primary ways to prevent COVID-19 infection. But if you're healthy and in self-isolation, there is probably little reason to lather up so frequently. The CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time - 'especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.' On its website, UNICEF lists a few more examples of when people should wash their hands: 'after touching surfaces outside the home, including money; before, during and after caring for a sick person; and before and after eating.' So if you're doing any of those things every 20 minutes, you may want to wash your hands. 'Try to avoid eating and drinking cold things' This claim is baseless. As we've covered before, there is evidence that human coronaviruses don't like heat. But just as there's no scientific proof that hot things prevent COVID-19, there's no proof that cold things make you more susceptible. This claim is similar to one made in a fake UNICEF handout that circulated on Facebook in early March. It said people should 'stay away from ice cream and eating cold' to avoid contracting COVID-19. In a statement, UNICEF debunked that claim. On its website, the WHO did, too. 'There is no scientific evidence that eating hygienically made frozen food and ice-cream spreads the new coronavirus,' the organization says. 'Wash metallic surfaces very carefully because the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days' There's no evidence to support this. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17 tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. 'SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),' the authors wrote. 'SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.' RELATED: Novel coronavirus could live up to 3 days, depending on the surface Aside from air, the least hospitable medium for the virus was copper; researchers could detect viable virus particles there for only up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel - up to three days. That's far from nine days, as the audio message claimed. And while the journal article hasn't been peer-reviewed, its findings are similar to those of other researchers. An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about the surface viability of various coronaviruses that infect humans, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19. The authors wrote that scientists found some of these viruses could live for up to five days on steel, and eight hours on aluminum. Another study they cited found a SARS virus strain remaining viable for up to five days on an unspecified metal. The article did find that one strain of SARS could live for up to nine days on plastic surfaces. But two other strains of the virus remained viable for only five days or less, and MERS could live for only up to 48 hours at a certain temperature. More recently, a March 23 report from the CDC said novel coronavirus RNA was found on surfaces on the Diamond Princess cruise ship 17 days after passengers disembarked. That finding raised questions about whether the coronavirus can last longer on some surfaces than previously thought, but researchers have noted that viral RNA doesn't necessarily mean live virus was present.",,,,An audio message lists five ways people can prevent the novel coronavirus.,refuted,false,<p>An audio message lists 10 ways people can avoid contracting COVID-19.

'There is no evidence that there are living particles in doses of the Pfizer vaccine. There is no accuracy to this claim,' Adalja said. Pfizer spokesperson Kit Longley wouldn't comment on the video, but told PolitiFact that the vaccine's messenger RNA technology helps the body recognize the COVID-19 virus' spike proteins and produce antibodies to fight off infection. 'The messenger RNA is injected into the body and enters cells, where it provides instructions to produce antigens, the substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies,' Longley said. 'The cell then presents the antigens to the immune system, prompting responses that can fight the disease. This process presents the body with the instructions to build immunity.'

The video recorded at a Panera Bread restaurant was genuine. It was posted and then removed by TikTok user @jadekirstenkellar5. It was later reuploaded by @mr.tiktok820.

The blog confirmed that it appeared to show several frozen menu items thawing: The video in question managed to rack up nearly 200,000 likes before being deleted by its creator, who is presumably a Panera employee. It didn't go in depth into how foods are made like some of these popular TikTok videos do, but in touring the food prep area of the restaurant, it revealed what looks to be frozen soups getting heated up, along with pre-packaged and potentially thawing chicken and macaroni and cheese. The video began by showing what appeared to be soups: Courtesy: TikTok After soups, the person recording the video claimed to show chicken: Courtesy: TikTok Third, the video ended by pointing the camera at mac and cheese: Courtesy: TikTok The Daily Dot and PopCulture.com pointed out that this was not the first time a TikTok video from inside a Panera Bread kitchen went viral. In 2019, TikTok user @briannaraelenee posted a video that showed the preparation process for the company's frozen macaroni and cheese. In addition to the menu offerings at Panera Bread restaurants, the company also sells in grocery stores a refrigerated version of its macaroni and cheese. Courtesy: Panera at Home Panera Bread defended its use of several frozen foods to USA Today: Panera spokeswoman Jessica Hesselschwerdt confirmed to USA TODAY that Panera does indeed freeze its soups and mac and cheese 'to avoid using certain preservatives that do not meet our clean standards.' 'We want to make sure that if you're in Massachusetts or California or in any one of our 2,100 locations that you get that same awesome experience,' she told USA TODAY. 'This is how we are efficient and how we make it consistent. We want that experience to be great, and that's the best way to do it.' On the same day, the Washington Post also spoke with Hesselschwerdt about the company's frozen menu items. She said that the company confirmed the TikTok video was genuine: In a statement, the company defended its preparation methods, explaining its mac and cheese is still a patently Panera product 'made offsite with our proprietary recipe developed by our chefs.' 'It is shipped frozen to our bakery cafes - this allows us to avoid using preservatives which do not meet our clean standards,' the company said. Many restaurants are reluctant to admit to heating up frozen food. After a survey of French restaurants found one-third acknowledged serving frozen items, some in the industry said the true number was probably higher because 'chefs were embarrassed to admit the short cuts that, in effect, hoodwink their customers,' as The Post reported. The woman who recorded the 2019 video apparently had worked at the restaurant but tweeted she was eventually fired. Before either TikTok video was available, on Jan. 31, 2019, the Washington Post published a story that rated the best and worst frozen and boxed macaroni and cheese options that were available at grocery stores: You might think, at first glance, that mac and cheese falls under the same tired adage as pizza: Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. The cheese in both scenarios may be of questionable provenance, but they're both smothered in it. Cheese can forgive the sins of mediocre pasta. Cheese is good.

The conflation of these two meanings is a common platform for humor, typically for satirical jabs at those who are either too naive or too stubbornly bound by ideology to allow inconvenient realities of the physical world to interfere with what they choose to believe.

You have all likely heard CAR quoted, or referred to in the auto industry news lately. Mr. Cole, who is an engineer by training, told many stories of the difficulty of working with the folks that the Obama administration has sent to save the auto industry. There have been many meetings where a 30+ year experience automotive expert has to listen to a newcomer to the industry, someone with zero manufacturing experience, zero auto industry experience, zero business experience, zero finance experience, and zero engineering experience, tell them how to run their business. My favorite story is as follows: There was a team of Obama people speaking to Mr. Cole (Engineer, automotive experience 40+ years, Chairman of CAR). They were explaining to Mr. Cole that the auto companies needed to make a car that was electric and liquid natural gas (LNG) with enough combined fuel to go 500 miles so we wouldn't 'need' so many gas stations (A whole other topic). They were quoting BTUs of LNG and battery life that they had looked up on some website. Mr. Cole explained that to do this you would need a trunk FULL of batteries and a LNG tank at big as a car to make that happen and that there were problems related to the laws of physics that prevented them from... The Obama person interrupted and said (and I am quoting here) 'These laws of physics? Who's rules are those, we need to change that.

We can repeal that law, amend it, or use an executive order to get rid of that problem. That's why we are here, to fix these sort of issues'. I feel so much better. I understand that Senator Isaac Newton is sponsoring Senate Bill Number 3.14.... to correct this errant package of laws preventing us from saving the world from the combustion engine. According to this account, representatives sent by the Obama administration presumed to lecture the auto industry about the type of alternative fuel/fuel efficient cars they 'needed' to build and were not put off by the rejoinder that what they were proposing was a physical impossibility, one of them cluelessly insisting that they could legislatively amend or repeal any 'law of physics' that interfered with their desired policy initiatives. We asked Dr. Cole directly about this anecdote, and his response was that it had been garbled: He said that although he did once encounter, in a meeting with members of Congress, the suggestion that a 'law of physics' should be legislatively amended, that meeting took place several years ago and did not involve representatives of the Obama administration (with whom Dr. Cole has never met): I have not met personally with the Obama Auto Task Force.

In May 2021, several news outlets reported that United Airlines had launched a promotion offering free air travel for some passengers who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. On May 24, for example, Business Insider reported that: United Airlines is now offering its vaccinated MileagePlus members the chance to win a year of free flights... If you're interested in having your post-vaccination 'revenge vacation' but deterred by these steadily increasing airfare costs, look into United's new 'Your Shot to Fly' sweepstakes, which was created to help 'incentivize people to get their shot,' Scott Kirby, United's CEO, said in the press release. You could win a free round trip or, even better, a year of free travel. United's MileagePlus members interested in entering the sweepstakes must upload their COVID-19 vaccine records onto the airline's Travel-Ready Center via its website or app by June 22. A similar article was published by The Hill. Those reports were largely accurate, and we are issuing a rating of 'Mostly True.' On May 24, United Airlines did indeed launch a sweepstakes offering rewards members who had been vaccinated the chance to win one of 30 roundtrip flights to any United Airlines destination, or a year's worth of free flights. Although the promotion was designed in part to encourage residents of the U.S. to get vaccinated against COVID-19, it was not strictly limited only to entrants who could prove they had been vaccinated.

23590,12864,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/george-orwell-people-accomplices/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"In times of political turmoil, George Orwell's words usually carry something relevant for everyone. One such alleged quote has been used on social media for many years, often to critique the election victories of particular figures and attributed to the famed writer who had also been a journalist with the BBC. The quote: 'A people that elect corrupt politicians, imposters, thieves and traitors are not victims ... but accomplices.' In order to determine its origins, we reached out to a number of experts at the Orwell Society - whose patron is Richard Blair, Orwell's adopted son - and The Orwell Foundation, which brings together Orwell scholars and awards the Orwell Prizes. Representatives of both organizations said that this quote could not be attributed to Orwell. A cursory internet search indicates Newsweek claimed Orwell wrote the statement in the 1940s. The quote was attributed to a collection of Orwell's essays in 'The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell: As I please, 1943-1945.' But we were unable to find the quote in an archived version of the book online. Leslie Hurst, a trustee of the Orwell Society, told us that this was not an Orwell quote, as it could not be found in his 'Complete Works' collection. He believes the line was loosely copied from a sentence about fascism (not elections) from an Orwell essay titled 'Rudyard Kipling': Whoever coined this phrase seems to have copied the construction of a sentence from George Orwell's 1942 essay 'Rudyard Kipling': 'Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists,' which suggests a certain intelligence and knowledge of Orwell's work, but while the statement 'A people that elect [...]' may be true it does a disservice to attribute it to Orwell. Benedict Cooper, publicity officer for the society who had most of the Orwell library digitized on his computer, also could not find the above quote in the collection. Hurst also pointed us to Wikiquote, which he said 'is very good with misattributed Orwell quotations,' but the above quote was not listed there. We also reached out to a number of academics, and we will update this post if we receive new information. Given that expert institutions associated with Orwell's work have not heard of this quote, we rate this claim as 'False.'",Did Orwell Write That People Who Elect Corrupt Politicians Are 'Accomplices'?

' We rate his statement True.","Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was not in a charitable mood Sept. 16 when he watched from afar as his 15 major rivals for the Republican presidential nomination debated on CNN. Gilmore was excluded because his polling numbers did not meet the 1 percent threshold for participation. He viewed the action from his campaign office in Alexandria -- first, the 90-minute 'undercard' debate between the bottom four candidates, and then the three-hour main event among the top 11 that drew about 22.9 million viewers. Gilmore live-tweeted through it all, accusing his colleagues of misunderstanding issues, ducking questions and exhibiting facial expressions that were unpresidential. And then, there was this tweet, made during the 11-candidate debate: 'Not one candidate on the stage has military experience, and it shows,' Gilmore wrote. We decided to check whether any of the prime-time debaters ever wore the uniform. Gilmore, it should be noted, has served in the military. Faced with a low draft number when he graduated from the University of Virginia in 1971, he enlisted in the Army for three years and served in the intelligence corps at NATO headquarters in Germany -- an experience he usually mentions in citing his qualifications for the White House. He rose to the rank of sergeant. As for the 11 debaters, we pored through biographies on their campaign websites and a variety of other authoritative sources for their resumes and backgrounds. No evidence of military service turned up for any of them. Three were old enough to be drafted during the Vietnam War -- Donald Trump, Ben Carson and John Kasich -- but managed to avoid conscription during an era when many college students received deferments from military service and draft numbers were determined by lottery drawings of birth dates. The draft effectively ended in December 1972, and the U.S. shifted to an all-volunteer military, but none of the candidates claims to have stepped forward either in the active military or the reserves. Participating in the main debate -- in addition to three candidates mentioned above -- were Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker (who since has dropped out of the race). The B Team What about the four Republicans who participated in the undercard debate? Although they were not included in Gilmore's statement, we thought it would be interesting also to look at their records. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., served as an Air Force prosecutor from 1982 to 1988 and then spent 27 years as a reservist, first in the South Carolina Air National Guard and then transferring to the Air Reserve. Graham, who was not deployed for combat, retired as a colonel in June. His three debate partners -- Bobby Jindal, George Pataki and Rick Santorum -- list no military service in their resumes. The Democrats While we're on the subject, let's look at the military records of the five most prominent Democratic candidates. Nothing is listed for four of them: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley and Lincoln Chafee. Former Sen.

It affects how an infant's body and brain develop, potentially creating both mental and physical challenges for persons born with the condition. Prenatal screening tests performed beginning at around 10 weeks' gestation can provide an estimate of the risk of a given child being born with Down syndrome, which may then factor into a parental decision to terminate the pregnancy. According to the most recent data available, the rate at which parents choose to terminate a pregnancy after a Down syndrome diagnosis is about 68 percent in the United States.

After-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 5.4 to 6.7 percent thanks to the Bush tax cuts. The same group would see incomes gains of 10.2 to 19.9 percent under the Trump tax plan, if not more. Measuring it in a different way, the top 1 percent received a tax break equivalent to 0.66 percent of GDP under Bush. Trump's tax plan would deliver a cut equivalent to 1.32 percent of GDP. We rate Clinton's claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7d98cf58-b2a5-4f26-9f42-bf63296e908d","With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton's alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate. When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most. 'His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two,' Clinton said. 'Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.' Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump's tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts? The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP. The evidence shows Clinton is right. The Bush tax cuts As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003, reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year). Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.) Trump's plan Trump's plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation, and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Two key provisions in Trump's latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check. First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.) Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently 'pass through' the business and instead are taxed as their owner's ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders. In its analysis of Trump's tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan's impact on individual taxpayers. The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here's a table breaking down Trump's proposed tax cuts by income group: Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. The think tank also said the Trump's cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump. The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break. Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years. While Trump's plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he's proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent - an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted.",,,,Says Donald Trump's tax plan gives the wealthy and corporations 'more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.,supported,true,,politifact

We rate this claim True.,"In a video ad, a super PAC promoting Gov. Rick Perry's presidential candidacy attacks two Perry rivals for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, suggesting that their records prove they are not conservatives. In the style of an old newsreel, the ad from Make Us Great Again, which was formed this year by Austin lobbyist Mike Toomey, a longtime Perry ally, highlights several criticisms that have been lobbed at the former U.S. House speaker and former Massachusetts governor. Among the charges the ad aims at Gingrich is that he joined U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 'in support of global warming.' We take the wording to mean that Gingrich aligned with Pelosi on the issue of global warming, a pairing that has drawn renewed attention lately. A similar claim is also being heard in a television ad placed in Florida and Iowa this month by another super PAC, Restore Our Future, which is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney. The ad attacks Gingrich over 'a ton of baggage' and includes the statement that Gingrich 'teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.' PolitiFact National looked into that claim for a Dec. 21, 2011, fact-check. The Restore Our Future ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of - you guessed it - more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one: 'Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming.' It is followed by a link to the Pelosi-Gingrich spot, in which Gingrich sits on a couch next to Pelosi, who at that time was the House speaker but now is the minority leader. 'We don't always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?' Pelosi says. 'No,' Gingrich answers, 'but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.' Pelosi: 'We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.' Gingrich: 'If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.' The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, 'Together, we can do this.' The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization that works to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. Formerly the Alliance for Climate Protection, it's now known as the Climate Reality Project. WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org. In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore said that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi. It was part of a larger campaign featuring ' 'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,' according to a 2008 news story in the San Francisco Chronicle. During the current campaign season, Gingrich has expressed regret about making that ad. In a section of his campaign website devoted to 'answering the attacks,' Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News' Brett Baier in November that making the ad with Pelosi was 'probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done.' It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past) and that he favors increased domestic oil drilling.

Independent experts said the report Obama was using as evidence represents a credible attempt to quantify recent improvements in preventing hospital-patient deaths, even if the numbers are estimates rather than hard figures. They added that it's reasonable to credit the health care law's Partnership for Patients program with accelerating the gains, even if the improvements were already under way at the time the law was passed. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.","In a recent speech marking the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama touted a number of accomplishments he credited to the law. 'The work that we've been able to do is already spurring the kinds of changes that we had hoped for,' Obama said. 'It's helped reduce hospital readmission rates dramatically. It's a major reason why we've seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals.' We hadn't heard the claim about preventable deaths, so we took a closer look. When we asked the White House for its evidence, they pointed us to a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Prepare yourself for its very wonky title: 'Interim Update on 2013 Annual Hospital-Acquired Condition Rate and Estimates of Cost Savings and Deaths Averted From 2010 to 2013.' The agency is a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, and its report takes a preliminary look at a program called Partnership for Patients that was created by the health care law. The program aims to get 3,700 hospitals -- along with physicians, nurses, employers, patients, government officials and others -- to work together to cut preventable hospital-acquired conditions by 40 percent between 2010 and 2014 and to reduce hospital readmissions by 20 percent over the same period. The report found that 'approximately 50,000 fewer patients died in the hospital as a result of the reduction in HACs (hospital-acquired conditions), and approximately $12 billion in health care costs were saved from 2010 to 2013.' This occurred 'during a period of concerted attention by hospitals throughout the country to reduce adverse events,' the report said. Independent experts said the report is credible. Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, 'I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit.' Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, 'which has been a serious - and successful - effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections.' He said it's the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but 'never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost. It's the first time we have seen measurable, significant decreases in any of the harms that we cause by treatment failures.' David Nash, dean of the Jefferson School of Population Health in Philadelphia, agreed that the numbers are credible. 'This is in part due to a huge amount of work on the part of hospitals,' Nash said. We do see two fairly minor caveats. • These numbers are estimates. Obviously, it's not possible to literally count the number of deaths prevented in the same way you can count actual deaths. So the authors of the report had to use a complicated set of estimating techniques to come up with the 50,000 figure. The authors of the report made a point of including some caveats, including that 'the estimate of deaths averted is less precise than the estimate of the size of the reduction' in hospital-acquired conditions.' The report also notes 'uncertainty inherent in our statistical extrapolations' and says that it's 'clear' that 'tens of thousands of deaths' have been averted, which is less specific than the 50,000 figure Obama focused on. • Preventable deaths had already begun falling even before the health care law was enacted. Periodically, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection has analyzed data on inpatient hospital deaths, with its most recent analysis covering data through 2010. That analysis found that the number of inpatient hospital deaths (not just preventable ones) decreased from 776,000 in 2000 to 715,000 in 2010 -- a drop of 61,000 over a decade. In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care law's passage; it's just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that 'the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood.'",,,,"The Affordable Care Act is 'a major reason why we've seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

One of those who came out in favor of more stringent gun control laws was California senator Dianne Feinstein, who issued a statement on the day of the Newtown shootings proclaiming that:As I have said many times before - and now repeat in the wake of yet another tragedy - weapons of war don't belong on our streets or in our theaters, shopping malls and, most of all, our schools. I hope and trust that in the next session of Congress there will be sustained and thoughtful debate about America's gun culture and our responsibility to prevent more loss of life.A few days later, Senator Feinstein announced that in 2013 she would be introducing updated legislation to 'stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons':'On the first day of the new Congress, I intend to introduce a bill stopping the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons as well as large ammunition magazines, strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds,' Feinstein said. 'I am in the process of gathering support for the bill in the Senate and House.' 'I have been working with my staff for over a year on this legislation,' Feinstein added. 'It will be carefully focused on the most dangerous guns that have killed so many people over the years while protecting the rights of gun owners by exempting hundreds of weapons that fall outside the bill's scope. We must take these dangerous weapons of war off our streets.'On 27 December 2012, a former Marine named Joshua Boston posted the open letter quoted above (under the title 'No ma'am') to CNN's iReport web site, stating his opposition to Senator Feinstein's proposed legislation.

To be clear, the poignant sound captured above, of heavy gunfire followed by silence at 11 a.m., isn't a literal sound recording, which wouldn't have been technologically practical on a battlefield in 1918. It's instead a recreation of the moment based on a technology invented by British soldiers called 'sound ranging.' As the German news outlet DW reports: Even as the armistice came into effect at 11 a.m., Allied soldiers were using state-of-the-art 'sound ranging' techniques to detect the location of the enemy. Rather than recording sound, the system recorded the noise intensity at any one moment onto a rolling piece of photographic film, similar to how a seismograph records tremors in the earth. Britain's Imperial War Museum, which had a set of graphic records labelled 'THE END OF THE WAR' among its artefacts, asked sound experts from the London acoustics firm Coda to Coda to use just such a photographic record - from the American front on the Moselle - to reproduce a soundscape of the moment of armistice. Despite its historical significance, the recording wasn't made for posterity. Sound ranging was used by soldiers on the front to triangulate the locations of enemy artillery. Here's a run-down from the Imperial War Museum on how sound ranging worked. ","Is This a Recording of the Guns Falling Silent During Armistice in World War I?

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In the wake of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, a series of unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud were circulated by U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters in an apparent attempt to sow distrust in the integrity of the election and cast doubt on President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Many of these rumors centered on Dominion Voting Systems, a company that provides election software to several counties around the United States. We have already debunked a number of these rumors (no, Dominion did not delete millions of votes; no, the company is not owned or funded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton; no, a 'glitch' did not switch votes from Trump to Biden), but new wrinkles are continuously being added to this conspiracy theory. One recent rumor claimed that a member of Biden's transition team, Peter Neffenger, sat on the board of Dominion Voting Systems' 'subsidiary' Smartmatic: There are a few kernels of truth to this claim. Neffenger, a U.S. Coast Guard admiral and former administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, is a member of one of the agency review teams aiding Biden's transition to the White House. Neffenger is also the chairman of Smartmatic's board of directors. However, Smartmatic is a competitor of Dominion, not a subsidiary. Eddie Perez, a voting technology expert at the Open Source Election Technology (OSET) Institute, a nonpartisan election technology research and development nonprofit, told The Associated Press that there is no connection between the two companies. Perez said: 'It appears that Mr. (Rudy) Giuliani is making some wild and unfounded claims that are connecting the dots between companies that appear to be unrelated.' Smartmatic and Dominion have also both published statements to address these rumors. Both companies noted that they are competitors in the election space and do not have any financial interests in the other's success. In November 2020, Smartmatic published a 'response to misinformation' to address some of the claims that had been circulating about the company. Smartmatic wrote: In the aftermath of the 2020 general election, there has been a great deal of misinformation being circulated about Smartmatic and other companies that provide election technology to voting jurisdictions in the US. We would like to dispel these incorrect statements with facts. Smartmatic has never owned any shares or had any financial stake in Dominion Voting Systems. Smartmatic has never provided Dominion Voting Systems with any software, hardware or other technology. The two companies are competitors in the marketplace. In another article, Smartmatic addressed some additional claims that circulated in the wake of the 2020 election. We reproduced the portions of the text relevant to this topic below: Does Smartmatic own any other voting machine company? No. Has Smartmatic owned any voting machine company in the USA? Smartmatic owned Sequoia Voting systems and sold it in 2007. Is Smartmatic's software used in other company's voting machines? No. Smartmatic's software is not licensed or otherwise used by other companies. Were Smartmatic voting machines used in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, or North Carolina? No. None of these states used Smartmatic technology. Is Smartmatic allied with any political parties? No. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country. Smartmatic's employees are required to adhere to a strict ethics code that, among other things, prohibits them from making political donations. Does George Soros have any involvement in Smartmatic? No. George Soros has never had any ownership stake in, or involvement with, Smartmatic. This fact was confirmed again by The New York Times on November 3, 2020. Dominion, too, has addressed these rumors. DOMINION IS NOT, AND HAS NEVER BEEN, OWNED BY SMARTMATIC. Dominion is an entirely separate company and a fierce competitor to Smartmatic. Dominion and Smartmatic do not collaborate in any way and have no affiliate relationships or financial ties. Dominion does not use Smartmatic software. The only associations the companies have ever had were: In 2009, Smartmatic licensed Dominion machines for use in the Philippines. The contract ended in a lawsuit. In 2010, Dominion purchased certain assets from Sequoia, a private U.S. Company. Smartmatic, a previous owner of Sequoia, pursued legal actions against Dominion. It should also be noted that, while Neffenger is technically a member of Biden's transition team, this does not mean that he has landed a future position in the White House. In fact, Neffenger is only listed as a 'volunteer,' as opposed to a 'detailee' or a 'full-time transition employee,' with the advisory team dealing with Homeland Security. Here is how Biden's 'Build Back Better' website describes the purpose of agency review teams: Agency review teams are responsible for understanding the operations of each agency, ensuring a smooth transfer of power, and preparing for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris and their cabinet to hit the ground running on Day One. These teams are composed of highly experienced and talented professionals with deep backgrounds in crucial policy areas across the federal government. The teams have been crafted to ensure they not only reflect the values and priorities of the incoming administration, but reflect the diversity of perspectives crucial for addressing America's most urgent and complex challenges.

His terminology was off, but the numbers he used check out, and his general point was correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than either Hispanics or whites do. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","During a campaign event in Portland, Maine, that attracted thousands of supporters, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a striking claim about unemployment among African-American youth. 'For young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school, who are between the ages of 17 and 20, if they happen to be white, the unemployment rate is 33 percent,' he said. 'If they are Hispanic, the unemployment rate is 36 percent. If they are African-American, the real unemployment rate for young people is 51 percent.' A reader asked us to check whether Sanders was correct, so we took a closer look. (Sanders seems to have made this a go-to talking point in his campaign; he offered a similar claim in an interview with The Nation.) We'll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn't identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate was 15.7 percent, for Hispanics it was 20.8 percent and for African-Americans it was 31.8 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows the same general pattern -- that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what's going on? Sanders' camp pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn't just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were 'marginally attached to the labor force.' The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren't entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of 'labor underutilization' rather than 'unemployment.' EPI itself used the term 'underemployment' in its research. It's a real statistic, but Sanders didn't really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term 'unemployment rate' and once used the variation 'real unemployment rate,' a vague term that doesn't have any official definition at BLS and wasn't mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting. On the other hand, Sanders' choice of statistics actually understated his broader point. Since it's reasonable to assume that dropouts have an even higher unemployment rate than high-school graduates, the figure for 'young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school,' as he put it, is probably even higher than 51 percent, since that figure includes only high school graduates. All in all, economists agreed that Sanders had a point despite his problems with terminology. 'He should have been clearer,' said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. 'But I think the overall scale is right. Both education and race are predictive of employment outcomes in the United States. A number of different studies show that even for the same levels of education, minorities appear to have worse average employment outcomes.'",,,,"For African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, 'the real unemployment rate ... is 51 percent.",supported,mostly-true,,politifact

Update (10:45 a.m. June 24): We've updated this item to make more clear that Cheney was talking about the total number of terrorists, not the number of terrorist groups. Our rating remains True.","Former Vice President Dick Cheney continued to criticize President Barack Obama over foreign policy during an appearance on ABC's This Week. While the focus is currently on Iraq and the growing prominence of ISIS, Cheney said Obama's miscues are broader and potentially dangerous. One statistic that he said supported his point: The sharp rise in the number of terrorists operating worldwide. 'We've got a much bigger problem than just the current crisis in Iraq,' Cheney said. 'The Rand Corporation was out in the last week with a report that showed that there's been a 58 percent increase in the number of groups like al-Qaida, Salafi-jihadists, and it stretches from West Africa, all across North Africa, East Africa, through the Middle East, all the way around to Indonesia -- a doubling of the number of terrorists out there.' In other words, he said we've got 'a hell of a problem.' PunditFact wanted to look into Cheney's point about the stark rise in the number of terrorists in groups like al-Qaida in recent years. His claim is nearly verbatim the findings of a report released June 2014 and prepared for the Secretary of Defense by the Rand Corporation, a nonpartisan think tank whose work is cited by Democrats and Republicans. The report focused on Salafi-jihadist groups, which are a specific category of militant Sunni Islamists marked by their emphasis on reclaiming a 'pure' Islam and the belief that violent jihad is required as part of religious duty. The report focused on these groups because most deem the United States an enemy and are willing to kill civilians on a large scale. The findings in the report are based on publicly available documents, such as internal memos, statements and other writings obtained from al-Qaida and other leaders by counterterrorism groups and news organizations like the Associated Press. Members of al-Qaida are an example of Salafi-jihadists, but not all jihadists are considered as part of al-Qaida or as formal members of its affiliates. The group taking over cities in Iraq, ISIS, is no longer part of al-Qaida after leader Ayman al-Zawahiri dismissed them in January 2014. Other groups in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Caucuses may occasionally work with or are allied with al-Qaida but are not members, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, which gained worldwide infamy for kidnapping about 250 Nigerian schoolgirls. Still, others operate as lone wolves inspired by the movement, such as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who shot and killed 13 people in an attack at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, and the Tsaernev brothers who executed the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The report did not include other groups trying to build an Islamic state and presenting a threat to the United States and its interests, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Taliban and Hezbollah, whose religious views are sometimes contradictory to Salafi-jihadists. All that said, the number of Salafi-jihadist groups (al-Qaida, its affiliates, other violent Islamists) jumped 58 percent, as Cheney said, from 31 groups in 2010 to 49 in 2013. The growth primarily happened in North Africa and countries along the Mediterranean Sea, known as the Levant, which includes Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. Figuring out how many jihadist fighters that amounts to is tricky, as the groups don't report their membership and their numbers can fluctuate. Still, the report says the population of fighters more than doubled between 2010 and 2013 looking at estimates both low (under 20,000 fighters to more than 40,000) and high (about 50,000 to more than 100,000). So, while the number of groups has increased 58 percent, the number of fighters in those groups has doubled, the report states. Here's a chart that shows the estimated increase: \ (Source: Rand Corp.) The biggest increase was in Syria amid the rebellion to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Further, Libya is 'perhaps the most active Salafi-jihadist sanctuary in North Africa' as a result of groups forming after the killing of its longtime leader, Muammar Qaddafi, wrote Seth Jones, the author of the report and director of Rand's International Security and Defense Policy Center. Membership has flourished partially because of weak governments in the Middle East and Africa, which not surprisingly has led to more attacks in recent years. Most, though, have been directed locally and not toward the U.S., its embassies or allies. There were roughly 400 attacks carried by al-Qaida and its affiliates in 2010, which rose to more than 900 in 2013, according to Rand. The report classifies the groups among three threat levels to the United States. Those presenting a high threat, meaning they are working on plots that target the United States and its embassies and citizens abroad, include core al-Qaida, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and 'inspired' individuals we mentioned earlier. Groups with a 'medium' threat, or plotting against overseas targets, are al-Shabaab (the Somali group behind the mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya) and Ansar al-Sharia Libya. The big question, of course, is what to do to address it. Jones' report urged U.S. military leaders to be more aggressive in targeting Salafi-jihadist groups in Syria, home to more than half of the jihadists in the world. The problem is the Assad government is not an ally. He also warns that a complete exit from Afghanistan could backfire by creating 'breathing space' for al-Qaida and other groups to regroup and spread. 'The American departure from Afghanistan will most likely be a boost for insurgent and terrorist groups dedicated to overthrowing the Kabul government, establishing an extreme Islamic emirate, and allowing al Qaeda and other groups to establish a sanctuary,' Jones wrote for the Wall Street Journal.

6825,6526,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lionesses-grow-manes/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 1 March 2017, a Reddit user posted a picture of two lions bearing manes and a caption indicating that five 'lionesses in Botswana have grown manes, developed a deeper roar to defend off rivals and even fight for territory': This is a factual statement. Though rare, the phenomenon of female lions growing manes and exhibiting other masculine traits has been documented both in the wild and in captivity. The specific group of lions in Botswana discussed in the Reddit thread is the most thoroughly documented example of the phenomenon, with a two-year observational study of these lions having been published in the African Journal of Ecology on 24 August 2016. New Scientist later recounted that report's context and findings: Male lions are distinguished by their mane, which they use to attract females, and they roar to protect their territory or call upon members of their pride. Females lack a mane and are not as vocal. But sometimes lionesses grow a mane and even behave a bit like males. However, until now, reports of such maned lionesses have been extremely rare and largely anecdotal. We knew they existed, but little about how they behave. The researchers collected data on five lionesses that had developed manes in Botswana's Okavango Delta. In addition to the physical appearance of a mane, the researchers also documented behavioral differences, including vocal calls and scent-marking behavior more typical of males. Lead author Geoffrey D. Gilfillan, a researcher at the University of Sussex, observed these changes in the primary target of observations, a maned female with the ID SaF05: 'While SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour - staying with the pride, mating males - she also has some male behaviours, such as increased scent-marking and roaring, as well as mounting other females. Although females do roar and scent-mark like males, they usually do so less frequently 'SaF05, however, was much more male-like in her behaviour, regularly scent-marking and roaring.' Despite the frequent copulation, however, SaF05 never once became pregnant - an observation that led the researchers to speculate that the behavioral and physical changes were associated with infertility. A photograph from Botswana of what appeared to be two male lions mating went viral in April 2016, but this photo was later determined to have captured a lion and a maned lioness mating. In discussing that photograph in National Geographic, Luke Hunter, president of the big-cat conservation group Panthera, suggested it was possible the development of maned lionesses could be either genetic or a fetal development: The genetic contribution of the sperm - which determines the sex of the fetus in most mammals - [could be] aberrant, giving rise to a female with some male characteristics. Alternatively and perhaps more likely, the problem may have occurred during gestation if the fetus was exposed to increased levels of androgens-male hormones such as testosterone. Testosterone is likely a big part of the story. As noted in New Scientist, a captive lioness at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa developed a mane back in 2011 that disappeared after her testosterone levels were corrected. Infertility, the story pointed out, is a side effect of elevated testosterone in females as well. While it is unclear what specifically causes the elevated testosterone, Lead author Gilfillan also thinks the cause is likely genetic: Given all five known maned females [in the wild] come from the Okavango region, there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon. According to New Scientist, this is not an active area of research - so it may be some time before we have more answers about the origin of the phenomenon.","Can Lionesses Grow Manes?

Most notably, Moore had disapproved of women's economic self-sufficiency; suggested that women should not be allowed to officiate at N.C.A.A. events; and made racially charged remarks about slavery, the Civil War and the presidency of Barack Obama. One of the many pronouncements in question was highlighted in a 30 April meme posted by the left-leaning Facebook page 'The Other 98%.' The meme featured a photograph of Moore along with the following text: 'Stephen Moore - Trump's Fed pick - wants kids to be working. 'I'm a radical on this. I'd get rid of a lot of these child labor laws. I want people starting to work at 11, 12' ... ' That widely shared meme prompted multiple inquiries from Snopes readers about the authenticity of the quotation it contained. Moore did indeed once say, in earnest, that he would favor getting rid of some child-labor laws, and he advocated for children and teenagers to enter the work force at a much younger age than they currently do. However, after those remarks were brought to light in April 2019, he stated that he did not support the elimination of child-labor laws.

The discussion, on the subject of minimum wage, was hosted by the Libertarian-leaning group FreedomWorks and featured Moore along with David Madland, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress' American Worker Project. Moore began his contribution by decrying what he presented as a declining rate of workforce participation among young people, saying, 'Young people are starting to enter the workforce at a later age,' something he described as 'a really big problem with the American economy.' He continued: ... What you may not know is that the biggest decline in labor force participation has not been among older people. In fact, older people are more likely to work now than they did before. The big decline in labor force participation has been people between the ages of 16 and 30, and that's highly problematic because if you don't start - the statistics are very clear on this - if you don't start - look, I'm a radical on this. I'd get rid of a lot of these child-labor laws, I want people starting to work at 11, 12. It's amazing how many people I meet who are successful ... who grow up on a farm and started working on the farm at age 10, 11, 12 years old, where you learned a work ethic. What is the point I'm trying to get at? I think the most damaging thing we can do right now to the U.S. economy is create further barriers to young people getting in the work force. ... So if we do have a higher minimum wage nationally ... we must must must must have a policy that has a six-or-seven-dollars-an-hour teenage minimum wage, because we're going to price a lot of those young people out of the workforce, and they're not going to get the training we need ... ' Moore's remarks can be watched in the video below: ﻿ Moore did not smile or laugh or give any indication that any of his remarks were intended to be anything other than earnest and serious. Furthermore, the quotation presented in the Other 98% meme was accurate, and did not contain any gaps or elisions. Although the meme did not (and could not) include the words leading up to and following the quotation, the meme did not misrepresent the sense or meaning of what Moore said. For those reasons, we issue a verdict of True. On 30 April, Moore provided a statement to the political news website The Hill in which he affirmed that he did not favor getting rid of child-labor laws, contrary to what he had said in his 2016 FreedomWorks appearance: 'Stephen Moore, whom President Trump has floated for an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board, responded Tuesday following newly unearthed comments about removing many child labor laws. 'I don't support eliminating child labor laws,' Moore said in statement shared with The Hill on Tuesday. 'My point has been that when people work at a younger age - i.e., on the farm or doing chores, a paper route, bagging groceries - those workers tend to have a higher lifetime income than young people who don't work.' 'Lifetime earnings are correlated with how soon a person starts working,' he added. 'We do a great disservice when we keep young people - teenagers - out of the workforce.'' The Other 98% posted its meme shortly before The Hill updated its article with that statement from Moore, so in addition to being accurate in and of itself, the meme did not knowingly leave out Moore's subsequent comments in which he resiled somewhat from his 2016 pronouncements.

That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama's claim is accurate. We rate it True.","President Barack Obama this week touted the progress his administration has made in recovering from the economic recession, focusing on developments in engineering and manufacturing. 'Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is the economy is growing stronger,' he said in a speech on Jan. 15, 2014, at North Carolina State University. 'Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.' PolitiFact wanted to know if Obama's claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers. A spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama's point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama's numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. 'Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,'Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It's no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there's less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn't need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can't tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it's worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country's dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration's fuel efficiency standards.",,,,"'For the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.",supported,true,,politifact

Scott Walker recounted leaving Marquette University in 1990 without a degree when he went to work full-time at the American Red Cross. That year, Walker also was busy launching his political career with an unsuccessful bid for state Assembly in Milwaukee. He later married and had two children, thwarting his plan to 'squeeze in a course here or there and finish things off in a year or two,' he recalled. Twenty years later, after stints in state and county government, Walker won the governorship. And on Jan. 15, 2013, he used the 'state of the state' speech to promote his efforts to help the University of Wisconsin System create a new online degree program for working adults seeking a less costly and faster way to finish off a degree. It's a program Walker has said he eventually may use to complete his own degree. Walker attended Marquette for four years and would have needed to stay at least another year to get a degree, according to a letter his 2010 campaign released. Walker said in the speech his situation is far from unique, noting 'nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree.' Amid the debate over workforce development and retaining college graduates, is Wisconsin home to that many people who started but did not finish college? When asked for backup, Walker's office pointed us to a 2011 policy brief by the private Indianapolis-based Lumina Foundation, which pushes nationally for an increase in the number of college graduates. Of Wisconsin residents aged 25 to 64, an estimated 22.8 percent reported having some college credits but no degree, according to the group. The report is dated January 2011 and uses 2008 U.S. Census Bureau data compiled annually from the American Community Survey. (As a point of comparison, the same year, 38 percent of Wisconsin adults in that age range held at least a two-year degree, the report found.) We confirmed the 22.8 percent figure using the Census Bureau's 'American Fact Finder' site. That's the figure Walker described as 'nearly a quarter.' We checked for more recent numbers, from 2011, and got a very similar number: 22.5 percent. That's as close to one-fifth as it is to Walker's description of 'nearly a quarter.' But still within rounding range. The figure represents about 684,000 people reporting post-secondary credit but no college degree. Women slightly outnumbered men in the group. 'College' includes technical schools. The Wisconsin numbers very closely mirror the situation in the United States as a whole. The Lumina analysis cited by Walker excludes adults under 25 and those over 64. That's a bit at odds with Walker talking about nearly a quarter of 'all adults.' But two researchers we spoke with said it was reasonable to use that age range for the comparison being made. Many adults under 25 are going to school, so excluding them from the analysis makes sense, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. And if the governor views the program as a workforce development tool, it's fair to analyze the situation using a figure that focuses on people under 65, said Noel Radomski, managing director of the Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education. The UW online program, which launches in fall 2013 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will be open to adults of any age, but the 'target market' is clearly working-age adults who want and need a more convenient way to attain their degree, said UW System spokesman David Giroux. Another study we examined, 'College Completion in Wisconsin: The Impact on the Workforce and The Economy,' used the same age range as the Lumina report.

We rate the Texas Democratic Party's statement True.","In a Feb. 3, 2012, press release, a Texas Democratic Party spokeswoman charged Republicans with using the Latino community 'as a wedge to gain support from the extreme wing of their party.' Among the examples of what the release sarcastically calls 'GOP Latino-outreach efforts' is this statement: 'Ted Cruz forcefully opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos.' The DREAM Act - which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors - would provide illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children a path to permanent residency if they attend college or serve in the military. The Democratic Party's statement led us to a two-part fact-check. Let's start with how Cruz, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, stands on the cited act. We didn't have to look far. In a transcribed interview with blogger Sonja Harris of Conservatives in Action that Cruz has on his campaign website, the candidate says: 'I do not support the DREAM Act and categorically oppose amnesty. I categorically oppose amnesty, and I strongly support legal immigration for those that have followed the rules and come here to pursue the American dream.' In December 2010, the U.S. House, which then had a Democratic majority, approved a version of the act. The proposal did not make it through the Senate. Critics of the plan, including many Republicans, say it amounts to amnesty for some illegal immigrants. So, Cruz opposes the act. But is it supported by 85 percent of Latinos? Fortunately for us, PolitiFact Florida recently looked into a similar claim in an ad from the left-leaning political group Presente Action. Concentrating on polls, our colleagues found many national ones that looked at general public opinion on issues such as the DREAM Act, and those polls included Latino respondents. But polls on the opinions of Latinos as a group must have enough Latino respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard. However, PolitiFact found two major polling groups that focus on Latinos: Latino Decisions and the Pew Hispanic Center. In its 2011 National Survey of Latinos, the Pew Hispanic Center found that 91 percent favored the DREAM Act when asked this question: 'Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children ... would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?' The most recent national poll from Latino Decisions, conducted in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC News, asked: 'Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?' It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law and an additional 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent. In each poll, the margin of error was about 4 percentage points. When we asked the Texas Democratic Party for backup information, spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña also pointed us to a February 2011 national poll by Latino Decisions, with impreMedia, publisher of Spanish-language newspapers in Texas, California, New York and other states. Respondents were asked about the DREAM Act in a section of the survey that began: 'In December 2010, Congress considered a number of different policies. For each policy that I read, please tell me whether you approve or disapprove and how strongly.' The poll described the DREAM Act as providing 'undocumented immigrant children a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military.' The results: 67 percent of respondents said they strongly approved of the legislation and 18 percent said they somewhat approved, for a total - again - of 85 percent.

Videos, pictures, and statements from people at the Capitol directly contradict Brooks' claim. We rate Brooks' statement Pants on Fire.","Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., asked people not to 'rush judgment' on who was behind the riots at the U.S. Capitol on the day Congress convened to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's election victory. 'Please, don't be like #FakeNewsMedia, don't rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation. All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics,' Brooks tweeted Jan. 7. Law enforcement officials are investigating the chaos and violence that transpired Jan. 6 when a mob stormed the federal building and forced Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers to evacuate their chambers. Antifa is short for anti-fascist; the term is often used to describe a loose collection of activists who rally against fascism and far-right groups. We reviewed videos, photos, news reports and social media posts around the siege. Our review shows that the rioters were President Donald Trump's supporters. The evidence that the rioters were part of 'antifa,' or that the assault was organized by that coalition, is weak. The claim is being made by supporters of Trump in an effort to distance themselves from the lawlessness at the capitol. Evidence that mob was pro-Trump, not antifa Before the mob breached the Capitol Jan. 6, Trump greeted supporters at a rally and repeated many baseless claims of election fraud. He told the crowd: 'I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.' But other parts of his remarks had a different tone. 'You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing,' Trump said. Photos show people inside the Capitol waving Trump flags and Confederate flags, donning sweaters, sweatshirts, beanies, red hats, green hats and other garments that said 'Trump' or his campaign slogans, 'Make America Great Again' and 'Keep America Great.' Lin Wood, a Trump ally and an attorney who has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the presidential election, tweeted a photo of a man he described as an antifa activist. But the man supports Trump and the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory; he's shared those opinions with his own Arizona community for well over a year. He replied to Wood and told him he was wrong, that he was not antifa. (Wood's account has been suspended.) A California Republican official also shared a picture on Twitter claiming that it showed men aligned with antifa. PolitiFact California rated her false claim Pants on Fire, noting that journalists who track far-right extremism identified one of the men in the picture as a neo-Nazi, not an antifa supporter. Facebook posts claimed that a facial recognition firm 'confirmed antifa infiltrated the Trump rally in D.C.' But that's not true. An attorney for the firm XRVision told PolitiFact in a statement that the company analyzed footage from the Capitol, identified several people and shared that information with law enforcement. The firm concluded that two of the men were affiliated with the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movements. 'These are two known Nazi organizations, they are not Antifa,' the statement said. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, urged Trump and all elected officials to condemn the violence that took place on the Capitol. His statement mentioned Trump supporters, and not people aligned with the antifa movement. 'While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the president using violence as a means to achieve political ends,' Wolf said. Statements from the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police and the acting attorney general said they were investigating the riots. Their statements did not suggest that antifa supporters were involved. Brooks' unsupported stance Brooks sent the following tweets as evidence for his claim that 'antifa orchestrated' the riots on the Capitol: '1. A Congressman warned me on MONDAY of a growing ANTIFA threat & advised that I sleep in my office rather than leaving Capitol complex & sleeping in my condo.

Congressman told me he was warned on TUESDAY by Capitol Police officer that intelligence suggested fascist ANTIFA was going to try to infiltrate the Trump rally by dressing like Trump supporters. '3.

Again, time will reveal truth. Don't rush to judgment. Don't be fooled by #FakeNewsMedia whose political judgment drives their reporting. My view: fully prosecute all!' PolitiFact asked Brooks' press office for the name of the congressman who gave Brooks the warning so we could get more information from that congressman. We also asked whether Brooks himself was alerted by Capitol police about antifa infiltrating the Trump rally. We requested that Brooks also provide any other additional information that supported his claim. We did not hear back.

If voters approve it in November, Oregon would join 10 other states and the District of Columbia in issuing driver cards to those who can't prove they are in the U.S. legally. Larson staunchly opposes the measure and takes every opportunity to say so on his daily broadcast. The claim: He recently sent us a series of emails, which he said verified one of his assertions about the cards: That the Transportation Security Administration will accept 'driver privilege' cards as valid identification to board a commercial aircraft. 'I have talked to the tsa and have emails to back up the fact that TSA WILL ACCEPT DRIVERS PRIV CARDS FOR ID AT THE AIRPORT,' he wrote in one. The ballot title for the measure, however, says: 'The driver card may not be used as identification for air travel, to enter a federal building, to register to vote or to obtain any government benefit requiring proof of citizenship or lawful presence in United States.' Could the ballot measure's own language be wrong? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: Several newspaper opinion pieces, including one written by former Hillsboro Police Chief Ron Louie, say driver cards will not be valid for boarding an airplane. Causa Oregon, a leading immigrant-rights group, agrees. 'Ballot Measure 88 clearly states that it will be issued only to grant driving privileges, and prohibits use of the driver cards for anything other than the listed purposes,' spokesman Erik Sorensen wrote us in an email. But Oregon's Driver and Motor Vehicles Services division added confusion in a 'frequently asked questions' document prepared for Measure 88. In response to the question, 'Can I use a Driver Card as identification to board an airplane?' the document says: 'It will be up to the TSA or the individual airport to determine whether to accept the Driver Card as identification.' A TSA spokesman in Washington D.C. wrote to Larson, according to an email he shared with us: 'Driver's licenses are a valid form of ID for TSA.' We contacted a TSA official on our own, Nico Melendez, a Western Region TSA spokesman in California. Melendez, after checking with Oregon officials and administration attorneys, said in a telephone interview: 'State-issued driver cards would be acceptable forms of identification for our document-checkers at the airport. At this point, the understanding is that a card like this would be an acceptable form of identification.' Whether an air passenger shows a TSA representative a driver's license or driver card doesn't matter, he said. 'What we are doing is verifying that the person who shows the card is the person who is traveling,' Melendez said. 'It's not an immigration check.' The ruling: Oregon voters on Nov. 4, 2014, will decide the fate of Measure 88, which, if passed, will allow DMV to issue driver cards to Oregon residents who can't prove legal residency. Supporters and the ballot measure itself say the cards could not be used to board airplanes. But TSA officials - the people checking passengers onto planes -- say otherwise.

His spokeswoman cited complaints about campaign volunteers outside a polling place. Complaints were filed against Anson County campaign volunteers accusing them of trying to coerce people into voting a certain way. And Bishop thinks local election officials didn't do enough to stop campaign volunteers from improperly assisting voters with their ballots. But the North Carolina elections board says it's not aware of any direct misconduct by Anson County election officials. We rate this claim False.,"President Trump says he might lose the election because of fraud. And a couple of his supporters in North Carolina say they believe the unproven claims about fraud could be true. U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, a Republican who represents a southern swath of the state, says he's seen hints of wrongdoing in his own district. 'Well, I'm echoing the President's claims. Indications of grossly improper conduct from election officials right here in my district,' part of his Nov. 5 tweet said. Is it true that there are 'indications of improper conduct from election officials' in his district? We reached out to Bishop's office and asked what he meant. Spokeswoman Hannah Hummelberg cited complaints about campaign volunteers at the lone early voting site in Anson County, which have been reported by WBTV and WFAE-FM public radio in Charlotte. These claims were investigated and addressed. But the actions in question were done by a candidate and his campaign volunteers -- not election officials. A quick summary The complaints: Officials received complaints that supporters of an Anson County Register of Deeds candidate, Dannie Montgomery, broke the law during early voting by assisting voters into the site and allegedly the voting booth. One voter said she was specifically told to vote for Montgomery, WBTV reported. 'As soon as I pulled up and exited my vehicle a campaign worker came up to me and forced me to vote for Dannie Montgomery and told me not to vote Greg Eudy (the unaffiliated candidate). As a first time voter I felt it wasn't fair to me,' the voter said in the complaint. What the law says: A voter can receive help only from close relatives - unless that voter has a disability. Voters who have a disability may ask for help from any person, with a couple exceptions. The law also prohibits assistants from influencing someone's vote. A response: On Oct. 23, the Anson County elections board held an emergency meeting to discuss the allegations. Meeting minutes show the board warned campaign volunteers about the behavior going forward. The Anson board received and investigated more complaints after that meeting but could not substantiate the allegations, according to Gina Clarke, the board's temporary assistant director. The state board of elections issued a press release on Oct. 31 to clarify North Carolina's laws about assisting voters The outcome: No Anson County election observers or board staff were found to have done anything wrong, according to Clarke and Pat Gannon, spokesman for the state elections board. Unofficial election results show Montgomery losing to Eudy, the other Register of Deeds candidate, and underperforming compared to Democrats at the top of the ballot. Montgomery appears to trail by more than 500 votes. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, Cal Cunningham and Roy Cooper all lead their respective Republican opponents in Anson by at least 400 votes. Republican concerns Bishop has tweeted about the Anson County allegations several times. On Oct. 29, Bishop tweeted a video of the alleged campaign volunteer in question. On Nov. 1, Bishop tweeted a letter that he sent to top state and Anson County election officials. He asked them to produce video showing the campaign worker's actions while inside the polling site. The same day, the North Carolina Republican Party sent a letter to Sherry Melton, director of the Anson County election board. The NC GOP noted that there had been 18 incident reports about Montgomery and her supporters. The party asked for the alleged rule-breakers to be banned from the polling site. The Anson board investigated complaints about the campaign volunteers, said Clarke, the board's temporary assistant director. She spoke to PolitiFact by phone on Nov. 10. Complaints filed after the Oct. 23 meeting were 'unfounded,' she said. 'We looked into each one of them,' Clarke said. She added: No election officials were found to have committed any misconduct. Important distinction The distinction between campaign volunteers, who greet people outside polling sites, and actual election officials, who conduct elections and count ballots, is an important one. We pointed out to Bishop's office that his tweet omitted this key context and asked if Bishop is aware of any direct misconduct by Anson County election officials. Hummelberg, the spokeswoman, said the congressman is 'just suggesting' that the county elections officials have been 'permitting' campaign workers to 'buttonhole voters in the buffer zone, accompany them into the voting enclosure and into the voting booth, and to direct them how to vote.' As we mentioned: the county and state boards addressed the complaints - just not in a manner that Bishop or the state GOP might have preferred. Anson officials held an emergency meeting, issued warnings and investigated the complaints,while the state elections board issued a press release.",,,,Says there are 'indications of grossly improper conduct from election officials right here in my district.,refuted,false,"<p>Bishop referred to Anson County, where Republicans have complained about campaign volunteers breaking the laws around assisting voters.</p>",politifact
22423,11386,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/queen-elizabeth-london-mayor/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 7 June 2017, the Patriot Beacon reported that Queen Elizabeth II had publicly contradicted London mayor Sadiq Khan by 'refusing' to retract an offer of an official state visit to President Donald Trump after Khan had suggested calling it off: After the terrorist attack in the United Kingdom over the weekend, London's Mayor Sadiq Khan called for Donald Trump's upcoming trip to his city to be cancelled based on what he said was the American president's 'alarmist' reaction to the attack. Days later, however, Queen Elizabeth shut Khan down in a big way. Breitbart reported that the Queen refused to retract her invitation for Trump to meet with her at Buckingham Palace, ruining Khan's plans to stop Trump from traveling to London. '[The president] appreciates Her Majesty's gracious invitation,' White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said when asked if Trump would still meet with the Queen. This sends a huge message to Khan, as it shows that the Queen has no intention of submitting to him and the agenda he is inflicting the city of London. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace confirmed to us that a formal invitation to visit the UK had not been extended to Donald Trump by Britain's royal family; Sean Spicer appears to be mistaken in referring to 'Her Majesty's gracious invitation.' Queen Elizabeth has not refused to retract her invitation, because she never formally extended one. Nor has she made a public statement on the matter, either before or after Sadiq Khan called for Trump's official visit to be cancelled. The Queen never intervenes in political disputes in any case, and her silence in the two days following Khan's remarks is entirely in keeping with normal practice and should not be interpreted as meaningful in any way. In January 2017, UK Prime Minister Theresa May did extend an invitation to the US President to visit, but it's unclear whether this will be a state visit or official visit. In the UK, a state visit is one where the head of state (Queen Elizabeth) formally hosts a foreign dignitary (in this case, Donald Trump). An official visit means the foreign dignitary is invited to visit the UK, but is not formally hosted by the Queen. The episode has proven controversial, with one experienced former diplomat, Peter Ricketts, writing at the time that May's invitation had put the Queen in a 'very difficult position.' In an interview with Channel 4 News on 5 June 2017, London's mayor was asked if he thought Trump's state visit should be called off: Well, my position remains the same - I don't think we should be rolling out the red carpet to the President of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for. 'His policies go against everything we stand for.' Mayor of London @SadiqKhan criticises @realDonaldTrump's response to the London attack. pic.twitter.com/X4gN4AN2ES - Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) June 6, 2017 Apart from the fact that the Queen has not 'refused to retract' her invitation to Trump (because she has not extended such an invitation), there are a couple of other inaccuracies in the Patriot Beacon article. For example, it cites the conservative web site Breitbart as reporting 'that the Queen refused to retract her invitation for Trump to meet with her at Buckingham Palace.' The 6 June 2017 article does not say that; instead, it simply quotes White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's response to a question on Sadiq Khan's call for a cancellation: Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked at the daily White House press briefing on Tuesday about London Mayor Sadiq Khan's saying that President Donald Trump's visit to the UK should be cancelled after the president criticized the mayor's remarks about the terror threat there. Khan said there was 'no reason to be alarmed' by an increased police presence in London following yet another terror attack on Saturday on the London Bridge. '[The president] appreciates Her Majesty's gracious invitation,' Spicer responded, referring to the invitation extended to Trump by Queen Elizabeth. The Breitbart article also does not describe Queen Elizabeth as refusing to retract her invitation or taking any action (or conspicuous inaction) following Sadiq Khan's remarks the day before. The Patriot Beacon article claims that Khan had called for Trump's visit to be cancelled on the basis of Trump's 'alarmist' response to the London Bridge attack. Khan never described Trump's response as alarmist, but said instead that his call for the visit to be cancelled was because Trump's policies 'go against everything we stand for'. Khan had already opposed an official visit by Trump to the UK in response to the US President's proposed immigration ban, and long before the June 2017 terrorist attack. In an op-ed for the London Evening Standard on 30 January 2017, the mayor wrote: The Prime Minister must be clear with President Trump that his actions are unacceptable for a liberal, open democracy. And we should not be seen to be endorsing them. That is why we must now rescind the offer of a full state visit for President Trump - until this ban is lifted. I don't believe the people of London will support rolling out the red carpet until this happens.",Did Queen Elizabeth Refuse to Retract an Invitation to President Donald Trump?

But much of the oddness stems from the fact that the transcript provides no context for the remarks contained therein; a little background helps to make it more understandable.After delivering his State of the Union address on 20 January 2004, President Bush undertook a two-day, three-state swing through Ohio, Arizona, and New Mexico. The morning of 22 January found the President in Roswell, New Mexico, where he delivered a 40-plus minute speech at the town's Convention and Civic Center in front of 1,800 cadets from the New Mexico Military Institute, law enforcement officers studying at the International Law Enforcement Academy's graduate center and the Federal Law Enforcement Training center, and localresidents.The President wrapped up his speech a bit before 11:30 AM, and he then surprised many Roswell residents by sending his motorcade to the Nuthin' Special Cafe on Main Street - described as 'a local eatery known more for its 50-cent beer than its food' - for lunch. After entering the restaurant and shaking some hands, the President decided to give the local economy a boost by strolling behind the counter and cajoling members of the traveling press into ordering some food. A couple of White House correspondents, David Gregory of NBC (referred to in the transcript as 'Stretch') and Terry Moran of ABC, tried to turn the occasion into an impromptu press conference, but President Bush held firm, stating in no uncertain terms that he was there to take food orders, not to answer questions from the press.According to cafe owner Armando Aceves, the President ordered pork ribs and buttermilk pie and autographed a menu. However, Jim Lakely of the Washington Times, a designated pool reporter for the Roswell trip, noted that the President was unsuccessful in convincing the reporters in question to purchase any ribs themselves. Once President Bush and his entourage were back on-board Air Force One with their take-out orders, someone from the White House staff sent some ribs back to the press corps. There wasn't enough to go around, though.A letter writer to the Albuquerque Journal later noted that President Bush did not leave a tip when he departed. But, as that newspaper reported, the Nuthin' Fancy Cafe staff still ended up with a larger payment than they were expecting:'But you don't expect a tip from take-out,' said Beverly Patterson, one of the servers who helped with the president's order of ribs, corn bread, butter and honey. 'And how many other people can say they had the pleasure and honor of having the president visit their place?' adds Patterson, who has worked at the cafe for three years. Bush paid for the order with $30 in cash. Patterson says the president called later from Air Force One and said, 'You didn't charge me enough, and I'm going to send more money.' But Edward Zavala, Nuthin' Fancy's manager, says he told the president they didn't want any more money. 'We were willing to give him the meal free, but the president wanted to pay,' Zavala adds. 'We didn't care for the money. This was a once-in-a-lifetime deal.'",Bush on Ribs,Does a transcript record President Bush's remarks to reporters at a New Mexico restaurant?,,Transcript records President Bush's remarks to reporters at a New Mexico restaurant.,supported,True.,"<p>'But you don't expect a tip from take-out,' said Beverly Patterson, one of the servers who helped with the president's order of ribs, corn bread, butter and honey.  </p> <p>'And how many other people can say they had the pleasure and honor of having the president visit their place?' adds Patterson, who has worked at the cafe for three years. </p> <p>Bush paid for the order with $30 in cash.</p> <p>Patterson says the president called later from Air Force One and said, 'You didn't charge me enough, and I'm going to send more money.'</p> <p>But Edward Zavala, Nuthin' Fancy's manager, says he told the president they didn't want any more money.</p> <p>'We were willing to give him the meal free, but the president wanted to pay,' Zavala adds.

24495,13939,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/how-to-create-a-social-state/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"Saul Alinsky was the Chicago-born archaeology major who, in the midst of the Great Depression, dropped out of graduate school and became involved first with the labor movement and then with community organizing. It was in the latter field that he made his mark, working from the late 1930s through the early 1970s as a community organizer (first in poor areas of Chicago, and later in various cities across the U.S.) seeking, often through unconventional means, to 'turn scattered, voiceless discontent into a united protest.' Along the way he authored the books Reveille for Radicals and Rules for Radicals to provide 'counsel to young radicals on how to effect constructive social change,' the latter of which opened with the following explanation of its purpose: What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away. Critics of President Barack Obama (who also worked as a community organizer in Chicago prior to embarking on his political career) have often linked his name with that of Saul Alinsky, sometimes in ways that suggest the two men knew each other and worked together. However, they never even met: Alinsky died of a heart attack in 1972, when Barack Obama was but a ten-year-old child living in Hawaii. Another prominent Democrat, Hillary Clinton, has also often been linked with Alinsky because she wrote her senior thesis on the topic of 'An Analysis of the Alinsky Model' while she was a student at Wellesley College in 1969. A much-circulated list of steps for 'How to create a social state' is another example of a political attempt to tie the names of Saul Alinsky with those of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: Beware the Useful Idiots Obama was influenced by the writings and philosophies Saul Alinsky, author of the book, 'Rules for Radicals,' and later by Frank Marshall Davis, with similar philosophies. Barak Obama followed the philosophies of these 'role models' throughout his days as a Community Organizer for ACORN, using tactics that appeared to some as 'shaking down' businesses in exchange for not branding them 'hate groups.' And apparently Obama is still following those radical rules today. Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books. How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky: There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state. The first is the most important. 1) Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people 2) Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. 3) Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty. 4) Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state. 5) Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income). 6) Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7) Religion - Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools. 8) Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor. Now, think ... Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? But this list is not something taken from the actual writings of Saul Alinsky, nor does it even sound like something he would have written (e.g., the line about 'controlling health care' is anachronistic for his era, and the idea of 'increasing the poverty level as high as possible' is the very antithesis of what Alinsky worked to achieve). This list is simply a modern variant of the decades-old, apocryphal Communist Rules for Revolution piece that was originally passed along without attribution until Alinsky's name became attached to it (presumably because someone out there thought it sounded like something Alinsky might have written). The closest analog (in form, if not in content) to the above-reproduced list of 'How to create a social state' to be found in the writings of Saul Alinsky is the following list of 'power tactics' Alinsky outlined in his 1971 book Rules for Radicals. Note that Alinsky's list is devoted solely to tactics (i.e., methods for accomplishing goals) and does not specify any particular targets of those tactics (e.g., health care, religion, gun control): Always remember the first rule of power tactics: Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have. The second rule is: Never go outside the experience of your people. When an action is outside the experience of the people, the result is confusion, fear, and retreat. The third rule is: Wherever possible go outside the experience of the enemy. Here you want to cause confusion, fear, and retreat. The fourth rule is: Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules. You can kill them with this, for they can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity. The fourth rule carries within it the fifth rule: Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage. The sixth rule is: A good tactic is one that your people enjoy. If your people are not having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong with the tactic. The seventh rule: A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Man can sustain militant interest in any issue for only a limited time, after which it becomes a ritualistic commitment, like going to church on Sunday mornings. The eighth rule: Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose. The ninth rule: The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself. The tenth rule: The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition. It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign. The eleventh rule is: If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counterside; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative. The twelfth rule: The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative. You cannot risk being trapped by the enemy in his sudden agreement with your demand and saying 'You're right - we don't know what to do about this issue. Now you tell us.' The thirteenth rule: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.",Beware the Useful Idiots A viral list supposedly reproduces community organizer Saul Alinsky's rules for 'How to Create a Social State.'

After speaking with the course's regional manager and a University of Florida gator expert (and seeing additional video of the gator), we can say this video holds up. We rate this claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e08e2288-592d-478b-bf29-54b23a8da7a2","If you've seen the viral video of a giant alligator strolling across a Florida golf course, then you've probably had the same reaction we did: Can that be real? The video, originally posted by Charles Helms on his Facebook page Wednesday, May 25, shows a large alligator meandering across the fairway at Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto. The alligator is so big (some have estimated it to be around 15 feet), one of the watchers suspected it might be 'two guys in an alligator suit.' 'I didn't know if we were being punked or something,' Helms later told reporters. Helms' video has since traveled the globe with similar expressions of shock and disbelief. It has been picked up by several news outlets including Golf.com, Time and The Guardian. The video posted on Golf.com's YouTube account has 6.1 million views as of this writing. Someone even mashed up Helms' video with scenes from Jurassic Park. So, is it real? We went to the Manatee County golf course to find out. Our hunt took us to Ken Powell, regional manager for Pope Golf. Powell oversees the 18-hole golf course. Powell said the video -- and the gator -- are indeed real. Powell, who moved to Florida five years ago, said the gator can most often be found roaming around holes 3, 8 and 14. You might see him several days in a row, or not at all for weeks, Powell said. 'He could be there,' Powell said. 'He could not. You're never going to know.' He offered us a ride on a golf cart to try and spot the elusive beast. Ken Powell points to the reservoir where the alligator is often seen. (Photo by Allison Graves) As we traveled along the edges of the bodies of water, we kept our eyes peeled for alligators of any kind, and especially for the ragged back of the now-famous reptile poking out of the water. Powell pointed out where he's seen the gator and noted that it often follows a path, from a creek near Hole 8 to the lake. Sometimes, the alligator hides in the nearby black culvert pipe feeding into the lake, Powell said. We opted not to poke our head in. The 150-acre golf course is home to many wildlife species and plant life. Powell estimates there are around 37 bird species and more than 150 plant and tree species. The golf course is open every day except Christmas, open to the public and costs about $25 to play in the summer. Estimates of the gator's length vary. Helms told ABC Action News in Tampa that it was around 14- to 15-feet long. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Florida record for a gator is 14 feet, 3.5 inches. We drove around the 8th hole and to the 3rd and the 14th. No gator. We stared off into the lake looking for him, but we only saw a pack of vultures and a few unique birds that hung out near the water holes. Cool. But not what we were after. After a thorough search, no luck. Powell showed a video he took from a different perspective, which shows the gator crossing a golf cart path, which he said is around 6 feet. He said the gator's tail was around 7 to 8 feet in total, and the entire gator could be double the length of the tail. Powell said he doesn't want to get any closer to say for certain. He also added that the golf course may have a contest to name the alligator. Frank Mazzotti, a professor and investigator for 'The Croc Docs' at the University of Florida, said that a large Florida gator would typically stretch 10 to 12 feet. In his estimation from watching Helms' video, Mazzotti said the gator was around 12 to 14 feet long. He said he doesn't think it meets record size. Mazzotti also noted that the angle of the image could significantly alter how one measures it. Countering disbelievers arguing that the alligator is not real, Mazzotti pointed to its gait - a 'high walk' - as characteristic of a large gator. 'An alligator moving from pond to pond - large alligators will typically engage in that behavior,' he said. 'They will get up in all fours and walk in what I would call a stately fashion for an alligator, just dragging its tail a bit.' Saddened not to see the mammoth gator, we prepared our goodbyes to Powell and thought about our drive home. Then, on our way out, right in front of the golf course, we spotted a darkish tail sitting in a shallow pond. Could it be? Could we have found it? As we inspected the water, the alligator outline became clear. We grabbed our phones, readied our camera. But it was just 2 feet long or so.

One version of the post that the Facebook page 'Politics Watchdog' shared was viewed millions of times. This doctored footage (which can be viewed in part below) was created by slowing down a clip of Pelosi speaking at a Center for American Progress event to make her words seem garbled and slurred. Here's the original, unaltered video from C-SPAN: The video circulating as if it shows Pelosi drunk and slurring was created by taking a clip from the above-displayed footage and slowing it down by about 25%.

Her speech pattern is bizarre.' (Giuliani's tweet has since been deleted.)

Rather, this clip was created by selectively picking a few brief moments in which Pelosi paused or stumbled (totaling about 30 seconds) while answering questions from reporters, and then cobbled them together to give the impression that Pelosi was 'stammering' through her news conference. Pelosi's full remarks (she spoke for about 21 minutes) can be viewed below:",Does This Video Show Nancy Pelosi Drunk and Slurring Her Speech?

FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, November 2015] There is a internet rumor where you could get paid to smoke Marijuana. This paid survey is said to pay 3000 dollars for testing use of smoking. Origins: In late November 2015, several marijuana blogs reported that the federal government was currently recruiting subjects for a study on marijuana. According to the rumors, participants would be paid $3,000 per week to simply puff the magic dragon for six months. One of the most popular versions of the claim was published by the Green Rush Daily on 28 November 2015: United States National Research Center (NRC) has been commissioned by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to conduct a medical study for research on the effects of marijuana on the body. 'This is one of the first, very promising studies, that will finally reveal the answer of the age old acquisition that marijuana users are 'Just Lazy',' said lead researcher Michael Gregory. 'It's an exciting new study that may push the legality of marijuana to all 50 states.' Each participant will be required to stay at the facility for six months, while doing various chores such as cleaning, reading, and watching TV, as they are evaluated by medical staff. Researchers are hoping to gather over 300 recruits into their facilities to begin this study. Similarly, a 25 November 2015 post on The Joint Blog originally concluded by stating: Researchers looking to gather over 300 recruits into their facilities before the study begins; these recruits will be paid $3,000 for every week they take part in the study. At the moment, the NRC isn't accepting new applicants for those wanting to take part in the study, though that's expected to change in the near future; we'll update this article when it does. However, a note later appended to that article noted that such reports were false: [UPDATE: NIDA has reached out to us to let us know that, in fact, they aren't currently conducting the above-mentioned study, as has been misreported by a number of media outlets. We apologize for the confusion.] Iterations of the rumor published in November 2015 neglected to cite any sources for the claim. the rumor's first appearance looked to be an early September 2015 article (now inaccessible) titled 'Clinical Study Will Pay You $3,000 Per Week to Smoke Marijuana' published by the fake news web site Newswatch33 (and previously to similar fake news site Now8News): Clinical Study Will Pay You $3,000 Per Week To Smoke Marijuana - https://t.co/YdJJxpT4tK - NewsWatch33 (@NewsWatch33) September 5, 2015 NewsWatch33 is known as a purveyor of fabricated news (arranged to look like a real news web site).

On 2 December 2015 a representative for the National Research Center (which has addressed the claim on its web site) contacted us regarding the rumor to say: I am with National Research Center (NRC) and I would like to also confirm that this marijuana study is fake and we are in no way conducting any research related to marijuana.","FALSE: Clinical Study Will Pay You $3,000 Per Week to Smoke Marijuana Sorry, it's fake news: the federal government isn't paying study participants a generous weekly stipend to smoke pot.

None of these articles, however, contained any actual reporting that matched these claims. Freedom Daily, for example, ran what was essentially an editorial masquerading as a news report: A United Nations panel in Geneva wants the United States to pay African Americans reparations for slavery. Sure, right after African Americans pay for burning down Los Angeles, Ferguson, and whatever other cities they destroyed. And right after that happens, let's find all the African Americans who are over 151 years old, which means they were probably slaves before 1865, and send them a check if there's any difference left over after they pay for rioted cities to be fixed. Sounds just about as dumb as a doorknob, right? The only part of the article that states anything resembling a fact is the first paragraph, wherein it's claimed that a United Nations panel concluded that the U.S. owes reparations to descendants of American slaves. The United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent presented just such a conclusion to the U.N. Human Rights Council in September 2016. There was nothing legally binding about the panel's opinion, however. The United Nations doesn't have the authority to force the United States to do its bidding. Moreover, the United Nations isn't 'led' by U.S. President Barack Obama (the current Secretary-General of the U.N. is Ban Ki-moon of South Korea, to be succeeded as of January 2017 by António Guterres of Portugal). Nor has President Obama expressed support for the idea of reparations - he has repeatedly argued against it, in fact, as exemplified in this statement from 2007: I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'we've paid our debt' and to avoid the much harder work of enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing; the much harder work of making sure that our schools are not separate and unequal; the much harder work of providing job training programs and rehabilitating young men coming out of prison every year; and the much harder work of lifting 37 million Americans of all races out of poverty. Although the idea of reparations for slavery is frequently (and hotly) debated across America, has been for years, and surely will be for many to come, there exists neither a plan for implementing them nor the expectation that such a plan will come to pass in the foreseeable future, much less 'immediately.'","Obama-Led U.N.

Chet Edwards, D-Waco, seeking re-election, lashed out at his GOP foe shortly after Bill Flores captured his party's nomination in an April 13 primary runoff. In an 'Opening Statement' campaign video posted online April 14, Edwards says the race will focus on his championing of veterans and his work for jobs and economic development. Edwards goes on to say Flores 'has been recruited by Washington, D.C., insiders to try to buy our district's congressional seat with millions of dollars he has made as a Houston oil executive even though he has never once voted in a general election in our district - not even once.' The charge that a wealthy candidate is trying to 'buy' elective office is common in politics; for this article, we're looking at whether Edwards accurately depicts Flores' voting history as a resident of the conservative-leaning 17th Congressional District. It covers more than 7,700 square miles in 12 counties, stretching from the suburbs of Fort Worth, south through Waco and east to Bryan/College Station. To back Edwards' claim that Flores has never voted in a general election in the district, Edwards' campaign pointed us to a Washington blog post and an article in the Dallas Morning News. Those reports and others published by the Waco Tribune-Herald and online Texas Tribune don't spell out all of Flores' voting history. But they touch on Flores voting in the 2008 Democratic primary. At that time, Rob Curnock was running unopposed in the GOP primary to challenge Edwards. In this year's primary runoff in April, Flores defeated Curnock to win his party's nod for the House seat. The Tribune's March 29 article quotes Matt Mackowiak, Flores' campaign manager, saying Flores voted in that Democratic primary in order to oppose then-Sen. Barack Obama for president, fearing Obama 'would take our country far to the left.' Mackowiak is also quoted saying he doesn't know which Democratic presidential candidate Flores voted for. Later that year, Mackowiak said, Flores phone-banked for GOP nominee John McCain on the day of the November election, got stuck in business meetings and was unable to leave in time to vote in the general election. To independently gauge Flores' voting history, we contacted Brazos County. Flores, who lives in Bryan, has said his wife moved to the county in 2006, according to a voter guide posted online by the Dallas Morning News. Mackowiak said Flores lived in College Station while the couple's house was being built in nearby Bryan. Kathy Schuetze, the county's voter registration coordinator, told us records show Flores voting five times there: the 2010 GOP primary and runoffs, fall 2009 elections related to the Bryan Independent School District and proposed state constitutional amendments, plus the 2008 Democratic primary Trying another source, we contacted Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin, who maintains a statewide voter database. Smith said his database indicates that Flores registered to vote in Brazos County in December 2006. He said that while Flores missed the 2008 general election, Flores' wife, Gina Bass Flores, did vote then. So, there's no indication Flores has voted in a general election in the district. Then again, we wondered if the 2009 balloting on proposed constitutional amendments also was a general election because it occurred on a date that state law defines as the possible date of a special or general election -- the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November. Randall Dillard, spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State, which oversees elections, said many voters might have thought they were voting in a general election. However, Dillard noted, the Texas Election Code defines a general election as an election, other than a primary, that regularly recurs at fixed dates. In contrast, state legislators pick the dates of elections on proposed constitutional amendments. Flores' voting record drew questions earlier this year. Flores said at a February debate that he voted for Curnock in the 2008 general election -- then later said he'd been joking, according to an online post by the Lone Star Project, a pro-Democratic group. We sought to interview Flores. Mackowiak declined our request. He also confirmed that Flores has yet to vote in a general election in the district.

Tina Smith, D-Minn., took to Twitter recently to tout her support for a $15 minimum wage. In the tweet, Smith wrote that 'one of the proudest things I did' as lieutenant governor serving under Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton was helping to raise Minnesota's state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour. 'Now, I'm proud to back a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024,' she wrote, referring to a measure introduced by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25, though states can set higher levels if they wish - and a majority do, from a small amount more than the federal level to $11.50 in Washington state. In a threaded tweet, Smith gave some historical perspective on the minimum wage: 'The federal minimum wage hasn't been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago. And prices for everything from milk to prescriptions has skyrocketed.' We wondered if Smith was correct, so we looked at the data. Back in 1968, the minimum wage was set at $1.60. That is equivalent to $11.76 in today's dollars, which is well above today's minimum wage level and an all-time high when adjusted for inflation. (We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator for this purpose.) Over the last 50 years, the situation in 1968 - greater purchasing power for the minimum wage than today - has been common, though not universal. By contrast, we only found seven years in which today's minimum wage is able to buy more than a previous minimum wage could. (Those years were 1989, 1995, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.) Here's the full chart, with the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage shown in red: All told, then, the minimum wage has been worth more than it is today for 86 percent of the time over the past 50 years, and less than today's during 14 percent of that time.",,,,"'Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago.",supported,true,,politifact
19513,7684,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/paul-ryan-confesses-national-tv/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 19 June 2016, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican who currently serves as Speaker of the House and will be chairing the Republican National Convention in Cleveland from July 18-21, appeared on the Meet the Press public affairs program. During that appearance, Speaker Ryan was questioned at length by interviewer Chuck Todd about the possibility of a 'Dump Trump' movement among Republicans that would seek to deny the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump at the convention despite Trump's having already secured enough delegates to guarantee a first-ballot win. Chuck Todd opened the segment of the program featuring Ryan with the following introduction: Good Sunday morning and happy Father's Day to all fathers out there. Like a canceled TV show, back for summer reruns, the Dump Trump movement has sprung back to life. Why? Well, just look at what's happened in the past week. Item one, in the wake of Orlando, Donald Trump's self-congratulatory tweeting and suggestion that President Obama may be in league with ISIS were universally criticized. Item two, our NBC News|SurveyMonkey poll among other polls is showing a sharp trend towards Hillary Clinton with Clinton now leading Trump by seven points in our poll, 49, 42. Item three, right now, while Trump is raising money and campaigning in states that haven't voted Democratic in at least a generation, Hillary Clinton is up on the air with a $23 million, two-week advertising blitz in eight swing states. 'But don't worry,' Donald Trump says, he hasn't yet started the general election campaign. And item four, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, whose interview with me you'll see in just a moment - essentially is giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to. Well, Trump reacted strongly to Ryan, and our follow-up conversation with him is coming up in a few minutes. But first, all of this is inspiring talk among jittery Republicans of yet another last-ditch effort to keep Trump from becoming the official nominee. Ryan's response to Todd's questioning might have been somewhat confusing to viewers following the current campaign drama. Ryan had previously called Donald Trump a 'racist' and denounced Trump's rhetoric and proposals, yet he endorsed Trump and has so far declined to rescind that endorsement. But at no time during that June 2016 Meet the Press interview did Ryan state that 'I don't care if Trump destroys the United States and that he is a liar and a fraud as long as we win in November' (the image shown above reflects someone else's partisan summary of what he said), and Chuck Todd opened the program by declaring that Ryan was 'essentially giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.' But what Ryan repeatedly maintained during that interview was that it was not his place (as Speaker of the House or RNC chairman) to attempt to take the nomination away from a candidate who had secured it under the party's existing rules and procedures; that he would opt (in Todd's words) to 'keep his party united [rather than] reject a presidential candidate whose values he does not share': Well, first of all I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the first district of Wisconsin, but as Speaker of the House. And imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House, and strong majorities in Congress. The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House. I don't want see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. Now having said that, you know me well, Chuck. If something is done and said that I don't agree with that I think puts a bad label on conservatism, then I'm going to speak out on it as I have, as I will continue to do, and I hope I don't have to keep doing. [Trump] won the election. The voters voted for him. That's the point. He's winning. He won the delegates. That's the choice they made. This isn't a top-down party where a handful of people pick our nominee, and the president. the voters picked him. That's the choice they made. We - What can I control? That's not something I can control. As Speaker of the House what I can control is, can I help add substance to this conversation? Can I bring ideas to the table? Can I lead the House Republicans to take our conservative principles, and apply them to the problems of the day to give people solutions that improve their lives, and try and inject some substance into this conversation, bring an agenda to the country? That's what we're doing. So here's what I worry about, Chuck. I don't worry everyday about what Donald Trump says and does. I worry about what I can do to help make this a better country, to help improve things, to help make this campaign one more about substance, and ideas. And that's what we're doing here as House Republicans. Go to 'better-job-dot-GOP,' look at our Better Way Agenda that we're rolling out. We're trying to add some substance to this conversation, so that people know where we're trying to go to get this country fixed. I'm Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. And that's who I am. And that's my responsibility. I'm not going to go into the hypotheticals. I have a responsibility. And that is to not try and disunify our party, and disrespect the voters - the Republican Primary Voters of America. And what I can control is can we add ideas. Can we add solutions? Can we bring substance to this conversation? The kind of election that I really want to have, that I wish we had in 2012, and prior years, is give the country a clear choice ... My place is because of again this role I have, which I feel has very important responsibilities, is to call balls and strikes, and just play it by the rules. So it is not my job to tell delegates what to do, what not to do, or to weigh in on things like that. They write the rules. They make their decisions. All I want to make sure is that [the nomination is] done above board clearly, honestly, and by the rules. So I see my role now given that he's got the plurality, he actually won, is pretty much a ceremonial position. But the last thing I'm going to do is weigh in, and tell delegates what to do - how to do their jobs. Some pundits have contended that Ryan will not disavow or roll back his support for Trump (no matter how much he might dislike or disagree with Trump) because he wants to see the Republicans take control of the government, but that's a speculative interpretation of Ryan's state of mind, not something Ryan has openly stated: The fact that House Speaker Paul Ryan will not rescind his support for a candidate he has called 'racist' clashes badly with the image of Ryan the press has helped create. When Chuck Todd interviewed Ryan on Meet the Press, he sounded exasperated and puzzled in equal measure. Given Ryan's denunciations of Donald Trump's racist rhetoric and proposals, Todd pressed him, 'How are you comfortable still supporting him?' Ryan's rationale was practically tautological: 'Imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress,' he said, despite growing evidence that Trump's candidacy will make winning the White House and holding onto strong Republican majorities next to impossible even with Ryan in his corner. 'You just made a case though of party over country,' Todd said. 'No, I didn't,' Ryan replied. For a man as close to achieving what no conservative in the history of the movement has achieved, Ryan's crass expediency isn't nearly as baffling as it seems.

However, the list includes a tacked-on coda positing that Coke is dangerous to drink due to its acidic content: 1. In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days. 3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl ... Let the 'real thing' sit for one hour, then flush clean. 4. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china. 5. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola. 6. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 7. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. 8. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan;rap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy. 9. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield. FYI: 1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 2. To carry Coca Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 3. The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! Drink up! No joke. Think what coke and other soft drinks do to your teeth on a daily basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of coke in 24-48 hours. That you can cook and clean with Coke is relatively meaningless from a safety standpoint. You can use a wide array of common household substances (including water) for the same purposes, but that fact alone doesn't necessarily make those substances dangerous to ingest. Nearly all carbonated soft drinks contain carbonic acid, which is moderately useful for tasks such as removing stains and dissolving rust deposits (although plain soda water is much better for some of these purposes than Coca-Cola or other soft drinks, as it doesn't leave a sticky sugar residue behind). Carbonic acid is relatively weak, however, and people have been drinking carbonated water for many years with no detrimental effects. The rest of the claims offered here are specious. Coca-Cola does contain small amounts of citric acid and phosphoric acid; however, all the insinuations about the dangers these acids might pose to people who drink Coca-Cola ignore a simple concept familiar to any first-year chemistry student: concentration. Coca-Cola contains less citric acid than does orange juice, and the concentration of phosphoric acid in Coke is far too small (a mere 11 to 13 grams per gallon of syrup, or about 0.20 to 0.30 per cent of the total formula) to dissolve a steak, a tooth, or a nail overnight. (Much of the item will dissolve eventually, but after a day or two you'll still have most of the tooth, a whole nail, and one very soggy T-bone.) By comparison, the gastric acid in your stomach's digestive fluids is much stronger than any of the acids found in Coca-Cola.",Do the Acids in Coca-Cola Make It Harmful to Drink?

The controversial Republican, who was elected the 50th governor of the Hoosier State, has been a long-time proponent of a 'Biblical view' on homosexuality and as a member of Congress stated that the legislative branch 'should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a 'discrete and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.' 'It[gay conversion therapy] was instrumental in helping me overcoming certain urges,' said the Vice President elect in an interview with Fox News.

There was no truth to this story. The site on which this story originated, the Nevada County Scooper, is a fake news site which we have highlighted for its bogus posts in the past. Besides failing to include any video of Pence's 'interview' with Fox News, it also invented a fake college roommate for the Indiana governor who used stereotypical language to describe his 'younger self': 'Oh Mike was always a well-groomed sharp dresser,' said University of Chicago Professor James Badwater who was a dorm roommate of Mr. Pence in 1983. 'He was private and kept to himself. He had a large collection of Men's fitness magazines and listened to Wham! continually. He got into the conversion thing the next year, and then immediately married Karen [Mike Pence's wife] the following year. It's going to be great to have our first gay Vice President.' The story did contain a grain of truth in quoting Pence's opposition to expanding anti-discrimination laws to include LGBTQ communities while he was in Congress. Pence has previously supported the idea of using federal funding to treat people 'seeking to change their sexual behavior,' but he didn't state outright such funding should extend to electroshock therapy, which was part of anti-gay 'aversion therapy' treatments until the American Psychological Association announced in 1973 that they would stop classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder.",Mike Pence: Gay Conversion Therapy Saved My Marriage Reports that VP-Elect Mike Pence said 'gay conversion therapy saved his marriage' are fake news.

Woodward then made an erotic 90-minute tape of himself and his wife Dannette but inadvertently left the tape in the VCR when he returned it to the store. The next person to rent the player got the tape as well, and soon hundreds of video copies of the couple's amorous adventures were circulating throughout town.As the incident was described in a contemporaneous news account:First-term Morris County Sheriff Corky Woodward went to the only video rental store in this farm town of 2,300 and checked out a camera, a videocassette player and some blank tape. Then he and his wife, Dannette, made a movie - 90 minutes, in full color, X-rated. But when Woodward returned the equipment to the store, he apparently left the tape in the player by mistake. And when the player was rented out again, so was the homemade movie of him and his wife. Suddenly the 32-year-old sheriff found himself with more public exposure than he knew what to do with. Copies were made and passed from living room to barroom to meeting hall as quickly as stores could sell blank tapes. Some people estimate there are more than 200 copies of the videotape in circulation, with a demand for more that has stretched well beyond Council Grove. The tape has been dubbed everything from 'The Sheriff Without His Pants' to 'The Sheriff Rides Again.' The tape and the month's worth of jokes and speculation that followed have divided the town into three camps: those who think it is funny, those who are outraged, and those who are embarrassed not only for the sheriff and his wife but for the entire community.Despite the apparently true origins of this legend, versions with differing details started to spread across the country within a year or two of the original events:The community in which the tape was made and circulated was variously reported as different towns throughout the USA and Canada. The tape was often said to have been returned to the video store in the wrong box (rather than being left in a VCR). The legend mutated into versions involving an anchorwoman who accidentally returned a sexy videotape of herself to the store, a high school coach who mistakenly sent the school board a tape of himself having sex with members of the girls' volleyball team, and a teacher who unwittingly showed the class a self-made sex film after mixing it up with an educational movie.Sightings: In an episode of the 1990's television sitcom Mad About You ('The Tape,' original air date 24 February 1994), Paul accidentally sends tape of him being romantic with his wife Jamie to the Family Network, having mixed it up with a tape of a zoo documentary. Also, a 1999 Volkswagen commercial featured a young couple who realized they'd just dropped off a similar video at the video store; when they recognized their mistake and returned to the shop, they were greeted by the sight of the store's customers transfixed at what was playing on the in-store monitor.A slightly different version of this legend appeared in the 1996 film Trainspotting.",Accidentally Returned Erotic Tape,A couple accidentally returns an erotic tape of themselves to video rental store.,"Brunvand, Jan Harold.

The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren't eligible for subsidies. And while we can't exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up. The missing nuance in Ryan's claim is that it doesn't acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn't have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we'll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Share the Facts Politifact 1 6 Politifact Rating: Obamacare is 'hurting people right now' with premium increases of up to 116 percent. Paul Ryan U.S. House speaker, R-Wis. At a news conference Thursday, January 5, 2017 -01/-05/2017 Read More info","U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has received a lot of criticism (and a False rating from us) for his claims that actuaries say Obamacare is in a 'death spiral.' But it's far from his only criticism of the former president's trademark health care law. Ryan has repeatedly brought up rising premiums as well, notably in his Jan. 5, 2017 weekly briefing where he ran off a list of increases for 2017. 'This law is hurting people right now. I mean, look at these premium increases,' the Janesville Republican said, then ticked off a series of states. 'This year Arizona, 116 percent increase in premiums. Tennessee, 63 percent increase in premiums. Oklahoma, 69 percent increase in premiums. Illinois, 43 percent increase in premiums. North Carolina, 40 percent increase in premiums. Nebraska, 51 percent. Pennsylvania, 53 percent. These aren't statistics, these are real lives,' he said. 'These are real families facing huge premium increases.' Are the premium increases Ryan cited correct, 'hurting people right now' and attributable to Obamacare? Numbers are on the mark The basic numbers are easy to confirm: Those increases are indeed accurate for 2017 compared to 2016 within the Obamacare marketplace. Arizona has by far the largest increase in the nation, and Oklahoma is second. The states all are among the Top 10 in percentage increase over 2016, according to estimates the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released in October 2016. As such, they are not a representative sample of all 50 states, but Ryan never claimed they were. And they are the headlines in a clear national trend. Premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Only one state (Indiana) saw premiums drop in 2017. The calculation is based on the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old, a plan widely used as a benchmark to compare rates between years and geographic areas. Premiums affect many people Ryan's description of the law as 'hurting people right now' is a bit subjective, but it's clear enough for us to examine since he later expanded on this by referencing 'families facing huge premium increases.' Obamacare supporters often claim premium increases are irrelevant due to the subsidies built into Obamacare. Those subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (that's $48,240 in 2017 for a single person). For 2017, 81 percent of consumers enrolled in the marketplace through Dec. 24, 2016 were in line to receive a subsidy. That means 19% of those insured will receive no subsidy and therefore bear the full weight of those premium increases (assuming they stay on the same plan). That's more than 2 million people, based on the latest enrollment data. Fair to attribute increase to Obamacare? The final hurdle for Ryan's claim is the matter of blame. He says the law itself is hurting people right now - in other words, that increases due to Obamacare go beyond the general trend of rising health care costs. This year's 25 percent increase is by far the largest since Obamacare began. Premiums rose around 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015, based on the HHS analysis of the same benchmark plan. For starters, that jump is far beyond what is expected industry wide. The National Business Group on Health estimates employees of the nation's largest businesses - an indicator of overall health insurance costs - will see about a 5 percent premium increase in 2017, based on a survey of 425 large employers. Obamacare premiums are rising far more in part because of several mechanisms built into the healthcare law that have ended or not worked as intended - reinsurance and risk corridors. Both were set up as temporary measures from 2014 to 2016 to subsidize the marketplace, artificially keeping prices low. Reinsurance was designed to reduce the incentive for insurers to charge higher premiums to higher-cost policyholders in the first years of Obamacare, which was accomplished by transferring funds to the plans for those policyholders. Risk corridors were designed to transfer money from profitable insurers to those losing money on the ACA exchange, discourage insurers from setting high premiums due to the uncertainty of the new market. They were originally pitched as a mechanism that would bring in money, then as one that would break even. But the latest data shows in 2015 claims from insurers for payment through the program outweighed the money paid in by $5.8 billion, so the expected funds weren't available to redistribute. Now that the programs have ended as designed, premiums are rising to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer plans in the marketplace. This is by no means an exhaustive accounting of the factors driving 2017 premiums upward. Experts say general growth in health care costs still play a role, as do changes in who is signing up, provider networks and the small group market, among others. Our rating Ryan said soaring Obamacare premiums are 'hurting people right now,' including one state with an increase of 116 percent. The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren't eligible for subsidies. And while we can't exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up. The missing nuance in Ryan's claim is that it doesn't acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn't have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we'll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

Journalists quickly confirmed it was edited and doctored with a fake news chyron. CNN confirmed the chyron graphic was fake. Twitter labeled the tweet 'manipulated media' soon after it was posted - the fourth time the social media platform took action against the president's online output in a month. pic.twitter.com/vnRpk0zl5y - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2020 The minute-long video starts with ominous music and a clip showing footage of a Black child running away from a white child with an edited banner purportedly from CNN, reading, 'Terrified todler [sic] runs from racist baby. Racist baby probably a Trump voter.' At 11 seconds, a title card appears saying 'What actually happened,' followed by a clip of the two children embracing. They then playfully chase each other around. The video ends with the card: 'America is not the problem. Fake news is. If you see something, say something. Only you can prevent fake news dumpster fires.' CNN covered the original real story in September 2019 with the title, 'These two toddlers are showing us what real life besties look like.' The viral video from New York City was originally posted on Facebook by the father of one of the toddlers, who said, 'With all the racism and hate going on I just think it's a beautiful video.' The two boys had been friends for more than a year. After Trump posted the doctored version, journalists took note of the fake chyron, with one saying,'This isn't even CNN's typeface.' CNN responded to Trump by telling him to 'Be better': CNN did cover this story - exactly as it happened. Just as we reported your positions on race (and poll numbers).

6587,5672,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-naacp-want-replace-national-anthem/, ,0,0,Fact Checks,,,"On 7 November 2017, the Sacramento Bee reported on a draft of legislation circulated to California legislators by the California Chapter of the NAACP aimed at replacing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' as the United States' national anthem: When California lawmakers return to the Capitol in January, the state chapter of the NAACP will be seeking their support for a campaign to remove 'The Star-Spangled Banner' as the national anthem. The organization last week began circulating among legislative offices two resolutions that passed at its state conference in October: one urging Congress to rescind 'one of the most racist, pro-slavery, anti-black songs in the American lexicon' [...]. As we have written about in detail, the view that 'The Star-Spangled Banner' is racist stems from the third stanza of the original Francis Scott Key poem ('The Defence of Fort McHenry') from which the lyrics to the song come. This section has been interpreted by some historians as glorifying the death of runaway American slaves fighting on the side of the British during the War of 1812: And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. Jason Johnson, a professor of political science at Morgan State's School of Global Journalism and Communication wrote in The Root: The story, as most of us are told, is that Francis Scott Key was a prisoner on a British ship during the War of 1812 and wrote this poem while watching the American troops battle back the invading British in Baltimore. That [...] is less than half the story. To understand the full 'Star-Spangled Banner' story, you have to understand the author. Key was an aristocrat and city prosecutor in Washington, D.C. He was, like most enlightened men at the time, not against slavery; he just thought that since blacks were mentally inferior, masters should treat them with more Christian kindness. He supported sending free blacks (not slaves) back to Africa and, with a few exceptions, was about as pro-slavery, anti-black and anti-abolitionist as you could get at the time. Of particular note was Key's opposition to the idea of the Colonial Marines. The Marines were a battalion of runaway slaves who joined with the British Royal Army in exchange for their freedom. The Marines were not only a terrifying example of what slaves would do if given the chance, but also a repudiation of the white superiority that men like Key were so invested in. As reported in a piece for Public Radio International's 'The World', Johnson is not alone in this view, though other interpretations have been proffered: Many historians agree with Johnson, but some disagree. They point out that Key never told anyone what he actually meant, and some historians interpret his mention of hirelings and slaves to reference all of the invading British forces. They say it echoes similar rhetoric used since the Revolutionary War to describe the forces of the king of England, especially those units purchased from German princes. American writers contrasted these miserable hirelings and slaves with the virtuous all-volunteer citizen armies of America. In an interview with a Sacramento CBS affiliate, Alice Huffman, the president of the California NAACP, said: This song is wrong. It should never have been there, and just like we didn't have it until 1931, it won't kill us if it goes away. At the moment, the bill lacks a legislative sponsor in the California legislature. We have reached out to the California NAACP and Huffman for additional comment.",Does the California NAACP Want to Replace the National Anthem?

Elsewhere, the claim may be more of a jaw-dropper. In March 2010, after launching his campaign for governor, Walker used a TV ad to tout the money he has returned and the amount is also proclaimed on Walker's campaign website: Since being elected in 2002, Scott Walker has 'given back over $370,000 of his salary to the county.' The returned money was part of a 2002 campaign promise to cut the job's salary by $60,000 per year. Walker, the Republican candidate for governor, made the pledge in the wake of a scandal over lavish county pensions. His Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, has taken a jab at Walker, pointing out Walker has reduced his annual giveback from $60,000 to $10,000. The Barrett campaign points to a 2002 Walker flier, which includes the promise to reduce the county exec salary by $60,000 per year. That promise, however, didn't specify for how long Walker would reduce the salary by $60,000. And in April 2008, he was re-elected after telling voters he would reduce the giveback to $10,000. (Walker joked at the time, according to a news report, that his decision to give back nearly half of his $129,114 salary had been unpopular with his wife.) (For those wondering, Barrett has taken six furlough days, two in 2009 and four in 2010, according to an aide. He has been taking his full salary, which this year is $147,335, according to the city comptroller's office.) So now the $370,000 question: Has Walker really given back that much back? Let's find out. To get our tallies, we went first to the Walker gubernatorial campaign, which referred us to the county Department of Administrative Services. That office reports directly to Walker, so we also asked for figures from Milwaukee County Treasurer Dan Diliberti, a Democrat. Both offices agreed on the figures. Taking into account the partial year Walker served after being elected in 2002, and an odd number of pay periods in 2003 through 2005, Walker returned the equivalent of $60,000 per year from 2002 through 2007. In 2008, which was covered partly by the $60,000 promise and mostly by the $10,000 promise, Walker returned $18,846. And in 2009 and so far in 2010, Walker not only returned the equivalent of $10,000 per year, but he's also written checks to the county, for just under $500 each, for one furlough day in 2009 and six more furlough days in 2010. The grand total? Walker has foregone $375,070 in salary since being elected county executive in 2002 -- $5,070 more than what he has claimed during the gubernatorial campaign. Our summation is as simple as the math: In his initial campaign, Walker made a pledge to return $60,000 a year, though he later was re-elected on a smaller give-back pledge. He said his checkbook is more than $370,000 lighter -- and the county's coffers that much better off. The record shows Walker's claim is accurate. We rate it True.

With so much at stake, such a large enterprise is closely watched by the state's top politicos. The spotlight fell last month on the Georgia Lottery Board when one of its members resigned because she thought the panel was feeling pressured to hire Gov. Nathan Deal's budget director as the next lottery chief. The new chief, Debbie Dlugolenski Alford, a former director of the state's Office of Planning and Budget and a member of the lottery board, had never worked for a lottery. Some officials, including a state Senate leader, questioned the selection and Alford's qualifications. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson dismissed the criticism, telling an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter that half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired. Ultimately, the state lottery board unanimously confirmed Alford for the job Oct. 25. We wondered whether Robinson's claim was accurate. How many of the jurisdictions operating lotteries had directors without previous lottery experience? Was this an acceptable practice in the industry to roll the dice on an untested leader? And did a background in other professional fields qualify as related experience? The Georgia Lottery Corp. has been in operation for 19 years and has sales exceeding $45 billion, according to information on the lottery's website. Of that amount, more than $13.8 billion has been transferred to the state's Lottery for Education Account. At any given time, Georgia's lottery operates nine online or computerized games and about 40 instant ticket games. We asked Robinson for any documentation to support his claim. The governor's office provided a chart of lottery directors in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data, compiled by the governor's office with a July 24 date, included a list of lottery CEOs and their former or concurrent occupation. The chart also included a background column on whether the CEO had lottery experience. When asked, an office spokeswoman did not explain how the office qualified lottery experience, and whether it was based on any specific requirement such as length of time in office, training or related professional work. Not content to take the governor's office chart at face value, we did our own research on the 46 lottery chiefs listed on the chart. PolitiFact Georgia's research found that 22 directors on the list appeared to have no previous lottery experience, including the directors for the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands lotteries. The limited background information found on those two directors did not appear to include any previous lottery experience. For the most part, the governor's office was accurate in its assessments, if previous lottery experience included sitting on a lottery board or commission, or serving in some other job for the same state lottery, such as legal counsel. In a few cases, the chart information was incorrect based on our research of online biographies, related media articles or announcements and the lotteries' websites. For example, the chart lists former Georgia Lottery chief Margaret deFrancisco as having no previous lottery experience. In fact, DeFrancisco had been director of the New York Lottery before coming to Atlanta. And the governor's office listed Arizona's lottery executive director, Jeff Hatch-Miller, as having previous experience, but his biography included no mention of previous lottery work. Hatch-Miller's experience included time served on the state commission in charge of regulating utilities and time spent in the Arizona Legislature. Overall, the operation of lotteries is done at the state level. There is no overarching organization or federal department with regulatory authority. Within the industry, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, based in Geneva, Ohio, acts as the trade group for lotteries and provides support to lottery administrators. Membership consists of jurisdictions operating lotteries, including 43 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, five Canadian provinces and Mexico. Qualifications for lottery directors or CEOs are determined by the states, said David Gale, the NASPL's executive director. The NASPL does not keep statistics on lottery directors' backgrounds. 'With past experience you'll find a mix. There are some directors without previous lottery experience, but they have some business, budgeting and security experience that is significant in operating a lottery,' Gale said. Also notable, he said, some of the top lottery positions are appointed positions that can be political appointments. Direct experience in operating a lottery is not irrelevant, but it is only one of many qualities to consider in a CEO's role, said Paul Jason, director of the Public Research Gaming Institute. A director with ties to the governor's office or state legislature could be important in navigating between those offices and personalities and the lottery corporation, he said. Georgia's lottery has a 'deep bench' of talented top management that can deal with the management of the lottery and can help the incoming director, making direct experience unnecessary [for the director], Jason said.

It's important to note that the founders of Medicare expected that nearly every senior would be covered by Part B, while the Democrats' 'public option' today is envisioned as just one of many options in the health care exchange. We rate Price's statement Mostly True.","Rep. Tom Price of Georgia sent a letter to doctors in September 2009 urging them to oppose Democratic initiatives on health reform. 'If health care reform is taken down the wrong path, it will end in nothing short of disaster,' the three-term Republican wrote. Price, who is an orthopedic surgeon, singled out plans for a public option for the most criticism. 'As a fellow doctor, I know you have personally navigated the federal health care system of our first 'public option' - Medicare,' Price wrote. 'And I know your experience will tell you that government-run programs many times mean restrictive coverage rules, endless bureaucratic delays, and inadequate financing structures. . . . 'There will be no turning back, no reversing the government intrusion that Democrats desire,' he warned. 'Medicare began as a public option and now holds 97 percent of the market share.' We were interested in checking whether Medicare began as a public option and whether Price is right about its current market share. To check this, we turned to several books on the history of Medicare and spoke with a couple of experts in the field. It's difficult to concisely summarize decades of health policy and legislative history, but we'll try. Medicare had been discussed by presidents since the 1940s, but its big moment began in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson was elected by a large margin, along with Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate. Johnson relied on Rep. Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat from Arkansas, to craft the legislation and move it through the House Ways and Means Committee. Johnson kept close tabs on the process. There were arguments about what should be in the bill and how it should be paid for. Mills decided to combine the proposals of several factions into one package to maximize support. He started with the administration's proposal to cover hospital services for the elderly, now known as Medicare Part A. He also included a proposal promoted by the committee's senior Republican member, John Byrnes of Wisconsin, who wanted coverage for physicians' services, now Medicare Part B. Finally, Mills included coverage for poor elderly Americans, which is today's Medicaid. The histories of Medicare that we reviewed emphasized that the part of Medicare that covered visits to doctors' offices was voluntary. Here's how an April 8, 1965, report in the New York Time s described the plan: 'As revised, the bill provides the basic hospitalization and nursing care benefits originally proposed by the administration while covering major doctor bills and many other medical expenses under a supplementary insurance program in which participation would be voluntary. 'The basic benefits, financed by increases in the Social Security payroll tax, would be automatically available to persons over 65. The additional coverage would be available to those over 65 who enrolled in the voluntary plan and paid premiums of $3 a month. Half of the voluntary plan's cost would be financed by federal subsidies of about $600 million a year from general tax revenues.' Johnson signed the Medicare law on July 30, 1965, and the program's aministrators began an intensive recruitment drive. At the end of the first year, participation was up to 93 percent of the elderly, according to The Politics of Medicare , a history by Theodore Marmor. Subsequent research indicates that Medicare participation has remained very high among those who qualify for the program, at roughly 97 percent in recent years, according to Medicare: A Policy Primer , a 2005 book by Marilyn Moon. All of this supports Price's statement, with one exception. As we reviewed the history of Medicare, we noticed that legislators and policymakers drafting the legislation seemed to assume that Medicare participation would be very high. We could find nothing implying that Medicare coverage would compete with private insurers in paying for coverage. Marmor, author of The Politics of Medicare , confirmed that perception when we asked him. Marmor witnessed the Medicare negotiations firsthand when he worked as assistant on the drafting of the 1965 legislation. 'The voluntary part was a mirage,' he said. 'They fully expected most people to join, because the terms were so attractive. And that's exactly what happened.' This is markedly different from today's debate and discussion about the public option. Obama has said the public option would be one among many insurance proposals from which people could choose, and that it would be a backstop to keep private insurers honest. He also said it should not be subsidized by other tax revenues but pay for itself with customer premiums. A spokesman for Price said the Democrats can say the public option will be limited, but it won't be. 'While they claim it's a public option, the end goal is saturation,' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Price. We're noting that disagreement for the record. For a fuller explanation of the public option and how it fits into overall reform effort, read our story Health care reform: A simple explanation . But getting back to Price's statement, we find the following: He is right that Medicare was a public plan and its coverage of physicians' services was voluntary, which is another way to say 'optional.' And its participation rate among eligible seniors is close to 97 percent. But we take a notch off our rating to acknowledge that people disagree about whether the words 'public option' today are the same as Medicare's 'voluntary' Part B in 1965. It's important to note that the founders of Medicare expected that nearly every senior would be covered by Part B, while the Democrats' 'public option' today is envisioned as just one of many options in the health care exchange.

He was speaking against raising the minimum wage, arguing that the increase would threaten jobs while improving the lot of only a few working families. Our analysis of data that is available strongly suggests that the percentage of Virginia workers supporting families on the minimum wage might be even lower than what Obenshain mistakenly said. So Obenshain stumbled into a credible conclusion. We rate his statement Mostly True.","During a recent floor debate, state Sen. Mark Obenshain disputed contentions that raising the minimum wage would ease plight for many poor families. Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said the recipients of Virginia's minimum wage of $7.25 an hour are mostly young, single workers. 'There are 4.7 percent of Virginians who are minimum wage earners who are over 25 years of age working full-time and trying to raise a family,' he said during the Feb. 11 floor debate on a bill that would have raised the wage over two years to $9.25 an hour. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled Senate but died in the Republican-led House, where opponents said raising the wage would force employers to cut jobs. Even so, we were interested in Obenshain's statistic on minimum wage earners raising families and looked into it. We contacted Jared Walczak, Obenshain's legislative assistant, and he said there was an error. Obenshain mischaracterized an estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that has nothing to do with the percentage of Virginians raising families on the minimum wage. What the BLS figure tells us is that 4.7 percent of all U.S. hourly wage earners in 2012 were paid at or below the minimum wage. Of an estimated 75.3 million hourly earners, almost 3.6 million received bottom-line pay or less. The agency does not keep track of how many of these earners are raising families. What can we learn about Virginia minimum wage workers? Not much. BLS figures only tell us that an estimated 6.8 percent of hourly workers in the Old Dominion were paid the minimum wage or less. That's the sixth highest percentage among states, trailing from the top Idaho, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. In raw numbers, the BLS estimates 1.8 million Virginians were hourly earners in 2012 and, of them, 123,000 were paid the minimum wage or less. The agency cautions that its estimates may have a large margin of error due to small sampling sizes in some states, particularly small ones. For that reason, it says the estimates of low earners should not be compared to other BLS tables detailing overall employment numbers in each state. Despite Obenshain's botched explanation of the data, evidence strongly supports the senator's overall point that minimum wage earners raising families are a small part of Virginia's workforce. The BLS spreadsheets estimate that roughly half of the people earning minimum wage or less in the U.S. are 25 or older. If that trend applies to Virginia, it would mean about 3.4 percent of hourly workers are minimum wage earners are older than 25. That percentage would drop if the low earners not raising families could be weeded out. Our rating Obenshain said 4.7 percent of Virginians are minimum wage earners older than 25 raising families.

One of the talking points that emerged from the debate was the preparedness of each candidate, exemplified by this line from Clinton in response to a remark by Trump about her recent absence from the campaign trail: 'I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.' While legitimate news outlets such as Washington Post penned articles explaining how Clinton meticulously prepared for the debate, the non-legitimate Baltimore Gazette published a fake news article offering a different explanation - Clinton had received her debate questions a week in advance: The first presidential debate was held and Hillary Clinton was proclaimed the winner by the media. Indeed Clinton was able to turn in a strong debate performance, but did she do so fairly? Multiple reports and leaked information from inside the Clinton camp claim that the Clinton campaign was given the entire set of debate questions an entire week before the actual debate. Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton's campaign headquarters, according to multiple sources. The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee. The above-quoted story is a piece of fake news from a relatively new fake news site. While the Baltimore Gazette does not carry a disclaimer labeling its content as fiction, several factors give away that it is not the outlet of a legitimate newspaper or news organization, but rather a hastily thrown-together hoax site. Everything about Baltimore Gazette site is generic: the social media buttons don't link to any online presence, several of the news topic sections are merely placeholders with no content, and the physical address provided in the 'contact us' section is a non-existent one that would place the newspaper in the middle of the Lockwood Plaza shopping mall. The site also already has a track record of publishing demonstrably fake news stories. This fake news story about the first presidential debate was a complete fabrication and is unrelated to later claims that Donna Brazile might have provided the Clinton campaign previews of questions to be asked at much earlier Democratic primary (i.e., non-presidential) events.",Clinton Received Debate Questions Week Before Debate A fake news story reported that Hillary Clinton was given her questions for the first presidential debate of 2016 a week in advance.

During a Dec. 20 interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, pointed to that statistic and other achievements as examples of what he's been able to accomplish in the face of a Democratic-controlled Legislature. 'And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001,' Christie told hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. 'So, we've made government smaller. We've made it smarter. We've made it less expensive for people. And we've done that with a Democratic Legislature.' PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie's numbers are solid. Based on the latest preliminary statistics from state and federal officials, the number of 'state government' workers dropped to 137,800 in November, which represents 600 fewer employees than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001. Let's break down the figures. When Whitman stepped down to become head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, there were 138,400 state workers, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the time Christie took office in January 2010, the number of state government employees had increased to 151,900, marking a jump of nearly 10 percent since January 2001. As of November of this year, the number of state workers had fallen during Christie's tenure by 14,100, or about 9.3 percent. When compared to Whitman's final month in office, the decline is a more modest 0.4 percent, or 600 workers, but nevertheless, it's still a reduction. Those statistics include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit. But these figures don't account for public employees in municipal and county governments, and local school districts. Between the executive, legislative and judicial branches, the number of state employees has dropped by about 4,738 from when Christie took office to November, state officials said. Most of the staff reductions have been due to retirements, with only 743 positions eliminated through layoffs, officials said. 'As to attrition, there has been a concerted effort by the administration to shrink the size of state government, which had grown too large and costly. At the same time, the Governor has insisted that departments be efficient and effective in the delivery of services,' Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an email. 'As we all know as well by now, fiscal realities have required painful budgeting decisions at the same time.' The wave of retirements comes at a time when state officials have been demanding greater contributions from public-sector workers toward their benefits. Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, the largest union representing state workers, attributed the retirements to employees' concerns over benefits and the age of the workforce The reduction began with hiring freezes under former Gov. Jon Corzine, Rosenstein said. 'It is an aging workforce,' Rosenstein said. 'This is essentially attrition....This is all to be expected.' Rutgers labor professor Jeff Keefe also said a 'great deal of anxiety about benefits' is driving the retirements. When Christie took office, most public workers got the message that the state was facing significant long-term fiscal problems, Keefe said. Our ruling In a television interview, Christie claimed 'New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001.'

Rick Scott to purge Florida's voter rolls of noncitizens had Sen. Bill Nelson feeling a sour case of déjà vu. Nelson, a Democrat, links the hunt for illegal voters with the 2000 election -- before anyone even uttered the word 'recount' -- and Florida's botched attempt to remove felons from the rolls ahead of election day. He warned Scott about repeating the ordeal in a May 29, 2012, letter. 'In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons,' Nelson wrote. 'Many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not. And in a presidential election decided by 537 votes, that erroneous purge may have been a factor.' PolitiFact Florida wanted to compare the millennial purge with the most recent one, which the Obama administration ordered the state to halt on grounds it violates two voter laws. We'll examine the parallels and determine if Nelson offered an accurate recap of the number of voters affected by the infamous 2000 purge. 2000 As part of their 1998 elections reforms, state lawmakers told the Department of State to remove felons and other ineligible voters from the rolls after thousands of corrupt votes, including 100 votes by felons, were cast in a Miami mayoral election. The agency hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies, a subsidiary of ChoicePoint in Atlanta, for about $4 million to produce a list of probable and possible felons before the election. (Unlike most states, in Florida a felon's civil rights are not restored unless he or she is granted clemency by the governor and Cabinet.) The company warned the state that many people on the list would not be felons, but officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters -- that meant more felons off the rolls. People whose names appeared on the list of more than 50,000 names had to prove their innocence or automatically be dropped from the rolls within several weeks of receiving written notice. Twenty counties ignored the state's directive because they found the data unreliable, including the Madison County elections supervisor, who found her own name among suspected felon voters. News organizations unearthed numerous accounts of law-abiding citizens turned away at the polls because they could not prove their innocence. Several thousand people appealed to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and half were found to not be felons. The precise damage is pretty hard to calculate. 'I've seen numbers all over the map,' said Myrna Perez, senior counsel in the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is investigating the purge ordered by Scott. Nelson's figure comes from a 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation, the crux of which asserts at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged before the 2000 election -- 'the collateral damage from an aggressive and ill-conceived state plan to prevent felons from voting.' The Post's count included at least 108 citizens who were cleared after the election and 996 people who committed felonies in other states (they were supposed to retain their civil rights even in Florida). Other tallies put the number of bad targets 11 or 20 times higher. The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000 partly over the felon voter purge, arguing it disenfranchised black voters. A consent decree from the lawsuit settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards. The exercise resulted in 12,023 fewer Floridians making the felon list, meaning these people could have been targeted as felons and denied the right to vote, reported the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) in 2003. Some caveats: This figure does not mean 12,000 people were purged without cause. It means they could have been. Plus, some people within this class might not have been affected anyway because some supervisors decided not to enforce the purge. A massive story about the 2000 election by Vanity Fair identified 20,000 people who were wrongly included. We don't know where that number comes from and will update this story if we find out. Nelson should have used that much bigger figure, said Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho. 'I read the letter from Nelson and I laughed,' Sancho said. 'How come you didn't vet this better? You could have had a way bigger number.' We asked the state department for any data it might have but did not hear back. 2012 Twelve years later, Gov. Scott, who campaigned on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigrants, ordered state officials to clear the rolls of noncitizen voters. The state department whittled a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens to about 2,700 by comparing driver's license data, which contains some citizenship data, against voter rolls. County supervisors, again, were told to notify those listed by mail of the need to urgently prove their citizenship. And also like last time, some supervisors decided to sit out the purge. Already, a Pasco County woman and a 91-year-old World War II veteran from Broward County have made headlines for being wrongfully targeted. In fact, elections supervisors found that most names on the list belong to citizens -- probably because the motor vehicle department's citizenship information is out of date, the Miami Herald reported. Thirteen Miami-Dade residents have disclosed they are not citizens and ineligible to vote as a result of the purge, the Herald reported. It's for reasons like this that Republicans stand by the clean-up efforts. 'The implication of Nelson's letter is that eligible voters will not be able to vote, yet there is no evidence of this,' said Kristen McDonald, RPOF spokeswoman. Still, voter-rights advocates and some elections supervisors share Nelson's ominous sentiment. 'It's distressing and disheartening that this is happening again in Florida given the history of inaccurate voter purges of the past,' Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project, which is a program within the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Rolling Stone waded into the issue with a scathing report, quoting Sancho as saying, 'The state's supervisors of elections are very, very disturbed.' 'This was dumped into our laps at the 11th hour. Those of us who have been here long enough get this eerie similarity to the flawed felon databases of 2000 in Florida,' he told the magazine. Our ruling Nelson precisely cites a Palm Beach Post analysis that put the total number of people wrongfully dropped from the voter rolls in 2000 at about 1,100. Other estimates of wrongful targets are much higher, and experts about the 2000 election tend to go with those. Trouble is, we don't have exact figures. However, Nelson's broader point -- that a significant number of people were wrongly tossed from Florida's voter rolls -- is valid. And he did say at least. We rate his statement True.

We'll examine the parallels and determine if Nelson offered an accurate recap of the number of voters affected by the infamous 2000 purge. 2000 As part of their 1998 elections reforms, state lawmakers told the Department of State to remove felons and other ineligible voters from the rolls after thousands of corrupt votes, including 100 votes by felons, were cast in a Miami mayoral election. The agency hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies, a subsidiary of ChoicePoint in Atlanta, for about $4 million to produce a list of probable and possible felons before the election. (Unlike most states, in Florida a felon's civil rights are not restored unless he or she is granted clemency by the governor and Cabinet.) The company warned the state that many people on the list would not be felons, but officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters -- that meant more felons off the rolls. People whose names appeared on the list of more than 50,000 names had to prove their innocence or automatically be dropped from the rolls within several weeks of receiving written notice. Twenty counties ignored the state's directive because they found the data unreliable, including the Madison County elections supervisor, who found her own name among suspected felon voters. News organizations unearthed numerous accounts of law-abiding citizens turned away at the polls because they could not prove their innocence. Several thousand people appealed to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and half were found to not be felons. The precise damage is pretty hard to calculate. 'I've seen numbers all over the map,' said Myrna Perez, senior counsel in the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is investigating the purge ordered by Scott. Nelson's figure comes from a 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation, the crux of which asserts at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged before the 2000 election -- 'the collateral damage from an aggressive and ill-conceived state plan to prevent felons from voting.' The Post's count included at least 108 citizens who were cleared after the election and 996 people who committed felonies in other states (they were supposed to retain their civil rights even in Florida). Other tallies put the number of bad targets 11 or 20 times higher. The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000 partly over the felon voter purge, arguing it disenfranchised black voters. A consent decree from the lawsuit settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards. The exercise resulted in 12,023 fewer Floridians making the felon list, meaning these people could have been targeted as felons and denied the right to vote, reported the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) in 2003. Some caveats: This figure does not mean 12,000 people were purged without cause. It means they could have been. Plus, some people within this class might not have been affected anyway because some supervisors decided not to enforce the purge. A massive story about the 2000 election by Vanity Fair identified 20,000 people who were wrongly included. We don't know where that number comes from and will update this story if we find out. Nelson should have used that much bigger figure, said Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho. 'I read the letter from Nelson and I laughed,' Sancho said. 'How come you didn't vet this better? You could have had a way bigger number.' We asked the state department for any data it might have but did not hear back. 2012 Twelve years later, Gov. Scott, who campaigned on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigrants, ordered state officials to clear the rolls of noncitizen voters. The state department whittled a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens to about 2,700 by comparing driver's license data, which contains some citizenship data, against voter rolls. County supervisors, again, were told to notify those listed by mail of the need to urgently prove their citizenship. And also like last time, some supervisors decided to sit out the purge. Already, a Pasco County woman and a 91-year-old World War II veteran from Broward County have made headlines for being wrongfully targeted. In fact, elections supervisors found that most names on the list belong to citizens -- probably because the motor vehicle department's citizenship information is out of date, the Miami Herald reported. Thirteen Miami-Dade residents have disclosed they are not citizens and ineligible to vote as a result of the purge, the Herald reported. It's for reasons like this that Republicans stand by the clean-up efforts. 'The implication of Nelson's letter is that eligible voters will not be able to vote, yet there is no evidence of this,' said Kristen McDonald, RPOF spokeswoman. Still, voter-rights advocates and some elections supervisors share Nelson's ominous sentiment. 'It's distressing and disheartening that this is happening again in Florida given the history of inaccurate voter purges of the past,' Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project, which is a program within the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Rolling Stone waded into the issue with a scathing report, quoting Sancho as saying, 'The state's supervisors of elections are very, very disturbed.' 'This was dumped into our laps at the 11th hour. Those of us who have been here long enough get this eerie similarity to the flawed felon databases of 2000 in Florida,' he told the magazine. Our ruling Nelson precisely cites a Palm Beach Post analysis that put the total number of people wrongfully dropped from the voter rolls in 2000 at about 1,100. Other estimates of wrongful targets are much higher, and experts about the 2000 election tend to go with those. Trouble is, we don't have exact figures. However, Nelson's broader point -- that a significant number of people were wrongly tossed from Florida's voter rolls -- is valid. And he did say at least. We rate his statement True.",,,,"'In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons.

After being asked for her thoughts on the situation, Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to frame the question into the larger debate over police violence and racial tension in America. 'I will tell you one thing,' Clinton said to a group of reporters. 'If that gorilla was white, this situation would have ended differently. This was another senseless act of violence that spawned from prejudicial views about skin color.' 'Trayvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Michael Brown - now you can add Harambe to that list,' Clinton continued. The Trump campaign has not yet responded to Clinton's comments, but a representative from Black Lives Matter applauded what they called Clinton's 'courageous stand against injustice.'

John Kasich's $55.6 billion two-year budget proposal is that a Republican leader who subscribes to the politics of limiting government spending is actually proposing to tap the state's checkbook for a lot more cash than his Democratic predecessor ever did. That's a fact not lost on state Rep. Armond Budish, a Beachwood Democrat, who grabbed a pen and paper last month to rail against The Columbus Dispatch's endorsement of the governor's proposal. 'Despite the dramatic cuts targeted at schools and local communities, Kasich's budget increases state spending from $50.5 billion to $55.6 billion,' Budish wrote in a letter the newspaper published May 14. 'This is the second largest, two-year spending increase in Ohio history.' It is true that the governor's budget makes deep cuts to public education and local governments, especially in larger urban areas. And it is true that the current state operating budget which covers fiscal years 2010 and 2011 passed under former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and expires on June 30, made just $50.5 billion in appropriations. It marked the first time in more than four decades that an Ohio biennial budget actually spent less than the previous budget. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Budish's numbers. Ohio's general revenue funds budget is part of a larger state fiscal document called an all funds budget. The general revenue fund is where state taxpayer money goes. It includes income, sales and other state taxes. The all funds budget, which is about double the general revenue fund, also includes money raised through various state licenses and fees and federal draw down funds for federally mandated spending and other items that lawmakers have little control over. Budish's numbers refer to the general revenue fund. In another letter to The Dispatch, one written in response to Budish's, state Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, said the GRF accounts for less than half of total state spending. Susan Ackerman, senior budget and fiscal analyst for the Center for Community Solutions, said that Amstutz is correct, but that Budish's message is in better context. When thinking of the budget, the figure to focus on is the general revenue fund number, not the all funds figure, she said. 'I think the budget to really watch is the GRF budget. The GRF budget is funded by Ohio's tax revenues and it is the budget that lawmakers have the most discretion over, therefor it gives you the most accurate picture of what the state's priorities are,' Ackerman said. 'The all funds budget is an important number, too,' she said. 'But the problem in Ohio is there is a lot of double counting in our all funds budget.' For example, state tax refunds are counted as expenditures in the all funds budget even though the state is essentially just giving back money that taxpayers overpaid, Ackerman said. And sales of state goods from one state entity to another is considered an appropriation under the all funds figure even though the money never technically left the state's coffers. 'GRF is really where your tax dollars go,' she said. But is the spending level proposed by the governor is the second highest increase in the state's history. We started by asking where the House minority leader got his facts. Budish's staff pointed us to a general revenue fund chart maintained on the Ohio Office of Budget and Management web site that lists the state's operating budgets back to 1968. That's just 43 years; not exactly inclusive of all Ohio history but enough information to test Budish's point. Kasich's proposal represents a $5.1 billion spending increase for a state still limping back from a crippling economic recession and deficit somewhere between $4 billion and $8 billion. The largest spending increase since 1968 came under Republican Gov. Bob Taft. The 2000-01 budget, which spent $40.4 billion, was $5.3 billion greater than the previous budget. We're talking actual numbers here, not percentage gains or losses. Since information prior to 1968 is difficult, at best, to completely recapture, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to add some perspective for the numbers that are available. The 1968-69 budget spent just $2.4 billion, so it appears safe to assume that never in Ohio's history prior had the state witnessed a spending increase greater than $5.1 billion from one budget to the next. From that perspective, Budish's statement seems logical. Lawmakers and the public have traditionally focused on the general revenue fund because it is the figure that lawmakers have direct say so over how to spend. Knowing that the GRF represents part of all state spending, and that the all funds budget is much larger, is an additional point that provides clarification. And while Budish couldn't provide documentation for his 'Ohio history' reference, it is clear that Ohio has never passed a general revenue fund budget prior to 1968 that is anywhere in the stratosphere of what lawmakers are presently debating in the Statehouse.

When he removed his legs from the water after about 30 minutes, they were covered in blood: Sam Kanizay, 16, was soaking his legs in the water at Dendy Street Beach in Brighton, Melbourne, on Saturday evening when he said he felt his legs tingling. He told Fairfax Media he presumed it was because his legs were sore from playing football and the water was cold. But after coming out of the water about 30 minutes later, he found his legs were covered in tiny sores which were oozing with blood.

While Kanizay is expected to make a full recovery, the issue of his excessive bleeding has remained somewhat mysterious. Walker-Smith suggested that some sea fleas might inject an anticoagulant into their food to prevent blood from clotting: [Walker-Smith] said it was not surprising that Sam's bleeding would not stop - this symptom had been seen in bite cases from crustaceans before, although she hadn't heard of it among crustaceans in this group. 'It is possible that the amphipod has an anti-coagulant that it released like leeches do, so it stops the blood from clotting.'
